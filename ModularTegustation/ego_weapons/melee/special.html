It scales with Fortitude.
This is more balanced than it sounds.
Think of it as if Fortitude adjusted base force.
Once you get yourself to 80, an additional scaling factor begins to kick in that will let you keep up through the endgame.
This scaling factor only applies if it's the only weapon in your inventory, however. Use it faithfully, and it can cut through even enemies immune to black.
Why? Because well Catt has been stated to work on WAWs, which means that she's at least level 3-4.
Why is she still using Eyeball Scooper from a Zayin? Maybe it scales with fortitude?</td></tr></table></main><footer>lobotomy-corp13.dme <a href="https://github.com/vlggms/lobotomy-corp13/tree/8096f0d29dfb1940687b51a76bdde0e8dce708d2">8096f0d</a> (master) â€” <a href="https://github.com/SpaceManiac/SpacemanDMM/blob/master/crates/dmdoc/README.md">dmdoc 1.9.0</a></footer></body></html>

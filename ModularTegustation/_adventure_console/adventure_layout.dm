 * TEXT BASED ADVENTURES

 *
 * The way i made this system is unusual to say the least. Its a stand alone datum that
 * is vaguely connected to the console that created it. While this does make the program
 * portable it also makes it so that when the console is destroyed there is just a datum

				NOTE_ENTRY:<br>\
				The purpose of this program is to dicipher recorded information about<br>\
				abnormalities. Any information unrelated to abnormalities or the<br>\
				enkanaphlin process is to be considered a flaw in the program.<br><br>\
				The process of deciphering abnormality data used to be a arduous task that<br>\
				exposed many to unforeseen mind warping effects. In order to alliviate the<br>\
				mental strain the process has been redesigned into a 'game'.<br>\
				Abnormal effects should be relagated to the occasional glitch<br>\
				<br><b>How to Play</b><br>\
				At the top of the screen you will see your stats. When your HP or program<br>\
				stability reaches 0 you will be unable to continue playing until it<br>\
				increases above 0. You recover 1 health every 10 seconds based on the<br>\
				time of your last action on the program.Coins seem to be only used in<br>\
				some obscure situations such as events. Coins are gained from battle.<br>\
				A dice is used to determine damage when you encounter a battle event.<br>\
				The value of this die can be used to reduce damage with block or inflict<br>\
				damage with fight. I did not say this was a great game. Event chance is<br>\
				the programs chance to present a event to you. Event chance increases the<br>\
				more you interact with the program. When traveling down paths in the<br>\
				adventure tab you will gain 3% additive chance to find a event. Winning<br>\
				battles will grant you a 10% increased chance. These events are generally<br>\
				related to abnormalities that you have within your facility. At the end of<br>\
				your shift a report will be expected on the events you encounter.<br>"

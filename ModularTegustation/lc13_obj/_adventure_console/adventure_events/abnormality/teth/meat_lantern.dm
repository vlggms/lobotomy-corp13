		broken only by the whispers of wind through the petals and leaves.<br>\

		But do you really want to be eating something that you found in the woods?<br>\
		For all you know it could be poisonous.<br>\
		As you think to yourself, a bird flies down singing absentmindedly.<br>\
		It had the same thought as you, but it doesn’t wait, landing to peck at the fruiting body.<br>\
		SNAP<br>\
		In a moment a giant mouth erupts from the ground swallowing the bird whole.<br>\

		Aren’t fruits usually formed from flowers?<br>\
		Not that it’s impossible for a plant to have fruits and flowers at the same time.<br>\

		Trying to eat this might not be the best idea.<br>\
		With that understanding you turn away<br>\

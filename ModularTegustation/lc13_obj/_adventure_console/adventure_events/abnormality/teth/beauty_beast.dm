		It has countless eyes, each rolling in agony, its body twisted so its<br>\
		insectoid limbs bend out at angles not fitting it's beastly form<br>\
		and a human like leg sticks out next to one far more beast like.<br>\
		Open wounds pulse on it's side, pus and blood leaking out across wiry fur.<br>\
		It turns towards you, mandibles clicking in something somehow resembling human speech.<br>\
		\"Free me from my curse, kill me.\" ",

		"\"Thank you!\" It groans as your plunge the knife into oozing flesh.<br>\
		It convulses, once, twice, and then collapses.<br>\
		You turn to leave, and trip.<br>\
		Your leg twists, snapping your foot as it elongates and thin gristly hair springs forth<br>\
		as your skin thickens into a shell of chitin.<br>\
		Your body bloats up, your bones ripping out of flesh until it grows like a tumor to meet your new body shape,<br>\
		your hand fuses together into a grotesque foot, while the other mutates into a paw.<br>\
		Trying to scream from the multitude of eyes blooming from your face makes your mandibles click.<br>\
		You are cursed, and want the relese of death.",

		You do not pick it up, instead turning to leave.<br>\

		But that isn’t your job, someone else can do that.",

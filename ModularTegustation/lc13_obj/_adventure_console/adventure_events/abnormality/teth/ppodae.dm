		Specifically one for a large sized Abnormality<br>\
		The only thing in it is a small fluffy boy with a petite mouth and large adorable eyes.<br>\
		It hops over to you, tail eagerly wagging as it looks up at you with pleading eyes.<br>\
		It is so adorable, so cute! Nothing could ever compare!<br>\
		There has to be SOMETHING you can do for him!",

		"Clearly no one has fed him recently! His bowl is nearly half empty!<br>\
		This can not go uncorrected! Thus, you being your quest to correc this neglect!<br>\
		The hallway outside the containment unit is devoid of anything.<br>\
		Returning to the chambers you strangely find the food in a closet inside the containment unit.<br>\
		Clearly someone had the good idea to alter the unit to make it more hospitable!<br>\
		There’s a few bones from a sekeleton for the good boy to chew on as well, you take some with as a treat.<br>\
		He looks so cute chowing down! It warms your soul to see him so happy.",

		"How could something this photogenic possibly exist?<br>\
		Taking out your phone you snap picture after picture, catching the good boy from every angle.<br>\
		Every single one of these pictures is too good to keep to yourself.<br>\
		As quickly as you take them you share them with others, deluging the net with Ppodae.<br>\
		Comments roll in, all of them in love with this most wonderous cutie.",

		"This little cutie can’t be left like this!<br>\
		He’s so lonely and needs attention.<br>\
		Thankfully you’re able to find a bone in a closet that shouldn’t be there for him to fetch!<br>\
		You toss it a couple of times, each time he takes it back showing off just how powerful his adorable body is!<br>\
		Wait, why’s he growing larger?",

		"Surely the managers didn’t make a mistake and put an actual dog in containment.<br>\
		After searching around you find the management notes in the workstation.<br>\
		Sure enough this is an abnormality, with a very long list of deaths it caused.<br>\
		Maybe playing with it isn’t the best idea...",

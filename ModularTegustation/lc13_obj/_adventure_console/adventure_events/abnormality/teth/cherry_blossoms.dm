		"You come across a beautiful scene of a tree on a hill.<br>\
		The sky is clear, letting the sun illuminate everything.<br>\
		Especially the vibrant pink cherry blossoms.<br>\
		Every petal is stained with colors too pristine for this world.<br>\
		Its branches spread out casting a cool shadow for anyone to enjoy.<br>\
		Even it's tan trunk, aside from a small yawning crack, is perfect.<br>\
		Just enough of a curve to be pleasing, but straight enough to be stable.<br>\
		All framed by the snow of pink petals slowly floating to earth.<br>\
		Who blessed the world with this?",

		"Accepting it's invitation you rest against it's trunk, basking in the shade.<br>\
		The cool shadows, pillowy grass, and firm trunk form the perfect spot to relax.<br>\
		You wake up as the sun begins to set, feeling rejuvenated.<br>\
		Your next stop isn't far, so with a stretch you return to the road.",

		"The tree is so perfect you could only sully it.<br>\
		So you gaze upon it, absorbing it's beauty where you couldn't deface it.<br>\
		And you are content with that.",

		"Approaching the tree, its trunk's  maw seems to draw you in.<br>\
		It's pitch black.<br>\
		But the darkness isn't empty.<br>\
		You're sure you can see something in it.<br>\
		So you reach in.<br>\
		Something latches onto your hand.<br<\
		Biting into your flesh as you rip away.<br>\
		Deep gashes cover your hand, as something slithers from the trunk.<br>\
		So you run, leaving it behind.",

		"Surely this tree didn't become so beautiful by happenstance.<br>\
		There must be some sort of root cause.<br>\
		And that gives you a place to start looking.<br>\
		Earnestly you begin to dig,<br>\
		Slowly the tree's roots are exposed.<br>\
		Every one of them clinging to a different skeleton.<br>\
		Some are the remains of small animals,<br>\
		Most are unmistakably human.<br>\
		Filled with morbid curiosity you continue digging,<br>\
		unearthing a fresh and very human corpse.<br>\
		As you watch the tree feed another branch blooms.<br>\
		With blood red flowers that fade into the beautiful pink you had admired.",

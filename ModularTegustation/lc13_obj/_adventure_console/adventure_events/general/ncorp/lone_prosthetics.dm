	It's head entirely transformed from flesh to steel. <br>\

	While it struggles in your grip, you cast your helmet aside and stare into it's eyes.",

	Plunging your nail through the heretic's chest, you feel righteous justice. <br>\
	This is what they deserve.",

	You cast them onto their back and bring your hammer down onto the heretic's body, again and again. <br>\

	You notice a leather wallet in the scrap pile. Its owner no longer needs it.",

	Pushing it to the ground and mounting its body, you apply force to its juggular with all of your might. <br>\

	Its body struggles to push you off. <br>\
	You apply force. <br>\
	It gasps for air. <br>\
	You apply force. <br>\
	It makes a noise. <br>\
	You apply force. <br>\
	You apply force. <br>\
	You apply force.",

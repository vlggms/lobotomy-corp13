	You lay dying amongst your own allies.<br>\
	Your assault on this town has failed.<br>\
	All that remains is the dying and the dead.",

	"Your eyes lay heavy, as the blood flows from you.<br>\
	There's no better way to die than dying for a cause among your comrades.<br>\
	When you wake up, you'll tell them about what happened here.",

	"You reach out for a friend. <br>\
	Gasping for air, a nearby kleinhammer grasps it. <br>\
	You look behind their visor, but can see nothing but the void.<br>\
	And as their grip loosens, with more blood flowing from their smashed helmet, you begin to drift off.<br>\
	Just a small nap. You'll wake up soon.",

	"Feeling the end coming soon, you begin to pray. <br>\
	You pray.<br>\
	You recite all the scriptures you remember.<br>\
	Feeling inspired, you pull your battered, bleeding corpse out of the town.<br>\
	And you pass out, in the dark of night, in a town you never knew.",

	"'Hey, Wake up.' <br>\
	Your eyes slowly open.<br>\
	A woman in mittlehammer armor, lacking the helmet, is sitting up next to you.<br>\
	The sun is shining down on the meadow, and her face is shining with a smile.<br>\
	And she begins to speak. <br>\
	'I'm glad I found you when I did.'<br>\
	'There was so much blood, 10 more minutes and you would have been a gonner,'<br>\
	'I'm so happy that I was able to help you.'<br>\
	She stands up. 'I'm a few hours late to get back. They're going to tan my hide.'<br>\
	She leaves you a can of bread and a bottle of water. 'Here. Have some food. And don't move.'<br>\
	She turns to leave.<br>\
	'I will come back here for you. I promise. Don't die on me.'<br>\
	The bread still tastes fine. But you can't help but feel empty.",

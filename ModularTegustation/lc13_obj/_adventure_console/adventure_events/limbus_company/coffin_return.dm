		You feel sympathy for the trapped being.<br>\
		Undoing the ropes, you begin to weep along with their wailing.<br>\
		One undone knot accompanies sorrow.<br>\
		One undone knot accompanies lamentation.<br>\
		When the last is released, you discover that there is no one inside.<br>\
		Perplexed, you examine the interior, and find a single, red-jeweled beetle.",

		It grabbed its speechless victim.<br>\
		A familiar note was added to the coffins wailing.",

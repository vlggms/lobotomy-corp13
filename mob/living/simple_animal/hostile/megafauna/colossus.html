<p>The colossus spawns randomly wherever a lavaland creature is able to spawn. It is powerful, ancient, and extremely deadly.
The colossus has a degree of sentience, proving this in speech during its attacks.</p>
<p>It acts as a melee creature, chasing down and attacking its target while also using different attacks to augment its power that increase as it takes damage.</p>
<p>The colossus' true danger lies in its ranged capabilities. It fires immensely damaging death bolts that penetrate all armor in a variety of ways:
A. The colossus fires death bolts in alternating patterns: the cardinal directions and the diagonal directions.
B. The colossus fires death bolts in a shotgun-like pattern, instantly downing anything unfortunate enough to be hit by all of them.
C. The colossus fires a spiral of death bolts.
At 33% health, the colossus gains an additional attack:
D. The colossus fires two spirals of death bolts, spinning in opposite directions.</p>
<p>When a colossus dies, it leaves behind a chunk of glowing crystal known as a black box. Anything placed inside will carry over into future rounds.
For instance, you could place a bag of holding into the black box, and then kill another colossus next round and retrieve the bag of holding from inside.</p>

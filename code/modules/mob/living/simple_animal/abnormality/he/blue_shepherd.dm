//Oh boy, here I go doing a complex abnormality after staying up for too long!
//He's kinda strong for a HE, has to take out other HEs.
//His lore is that he's strong to Red buddy (who does red damage) but the trick is that they don't actually fight ;)
//He just uses Red buddy as a means to escape but in reality he loves the little guy for it.

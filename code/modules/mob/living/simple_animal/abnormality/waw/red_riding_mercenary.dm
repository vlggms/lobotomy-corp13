	Her dynamic with each priority target is different.
	Against the wolf, she will instantly enrage, and continue enraged once he's dead if she didn't land the killing blow. Otherwise, de-enrage.
	Against a lone Buddy, she will enrage if brought to 50% HP, then de-enrage even if she doesn't land the killing blow, because she'll see through the ruse.
	If Blue Smocked Shepherd is within range of the above interaction, she will enrage against him, but de-enrage even if she doesn't get the kill.
	Against a requested target, once she lands the kill she returns to containment.
	If she encounters Blue normally, she will prioritize him, but not enrage.
	If lacking a priority target of any kind, and not enraged, she'll return to her cell after a few kills.

	- After completing work with 680 KHz, a message could be heard through the receiver. Employees were able to send a message back by inputting numbers into the work console.    <br>
	- After inputting the correct sequence and starting the work process, the work success rate was increased. Upon work completion, the sanity of all employees in the facility was restored.    <br>
	- However, inputting an incorrect sequence before starting work resulted in a lowered work success rate. The sanity of all employees in the facility was damaged after work was completed.    <br>
	- Working without inputting any sequence had no effects.    <br>

	- Anyone with this desire would be incapable of leaving the golden road should they step on it, and would be instantly driven insane should The Road Home reach the house. <br>
	- Damaging The Road Home will also hurt the attacker with black damage. The damage taken is halved if the attacker is standing on the golden road. <br>
	- If The Road Home reaches the house, another house with another path will be made.    <br>

	How to turn PE into weapons and armour from outside the corp <br>
	By sending some of our excess power to other Companies, Corporations and Associations, we may get ahn and gear in return from them after some time. <br>
	In order to do so, you will first need to purchase unrefined PE boxes from the Corporate Trade Console, under the Resources tab, for 50 PE each. Most facilities start with a few unrefined boxes. <br>
	(Disclaimer: Whether you're an Extraction Officer or a Clerk, avoid doing so much gacha that the Facility runs dry on PE for when an emergency happens and is needed.) <br>
	You may choose to also purchase PE filters, which you can use later. While these are useful, they are not essential, either. <br>

	In order to be able to send the PE boxes as power, you will need to refine them. <br>
	The Refinery is inside of the Information Department. To operate it, simply insert the unrefined boxes. The Refinery can hold one box at a time. <br>
	When you do, you will be given a Required Filter Strength (from 2 to 21). This is actually optional, as it simply speeds up the refining process. <br>
	If you do want to speed it up, you will have to reach the Required Filter Strength by adding in some PE filters, each with their own strength. Keep in mind they are all single-use. <br>
	You can examine a filter to see it's strength, which go as follows: <br>
	Blue (2 Strength), Green (3 Strength), Red (6 Strength) and Yellow (10 Strength) <br>
	Disclaimer: If you mess up and add too many filters, the PE box will be destroyed. <br>

	Once the refinement process is over, a Refined PE Box will come out, ready to be sent to others. <br>
	Make your way back to Extraction with the refined box and look for the wall with power inputs. In most facilities, there will be 4 randomly picked groups to send energy to. Simply use the box on the group's power input you want to send to. <br>
	After some time (and multiple PE boxes, likely), you will receive ahn and a crate to open. Apply crowbar to box, apply ahn to ID card. <br>"}

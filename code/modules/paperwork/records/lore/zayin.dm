	One Sin and Hundreds of Good Deeds	<br>

	A silent Abnormality that understands the conflict between good and evil. Its empty eye sockets stare at all those who encounter it.<br>
	A giant skull that is attached to a cross, it wears a crown of thorns. It floats about 2 meters above the ground."<br>

	"While its appearance is bizarre, it is rare to record an incident of violence against employees involving this Abnormality."<br>

	"It feeds on the evil that seeps out during conversations between people. The assigned employee must kneel before it (standing appears to be acceptable) and present their evil by confessing their sins to it. The way it feeds is unknown."<br>

	<h3><center>Excerpt from Experiment Records</center></h3><br>
	"We have cataloged the sins a person can commit into three levels.<br>
	Level 1: A small lie or action that either goes unnoticed or can be shared in jest.<br>
	Level 2: Sins that are more serious and only shared with the closest of friends.<br>
	Level 3: Sins so profound that they cannot be shared with anyone. These will be taken to the grave.<br>
	Employee REDACTED had been assigned to confess a Level 1 sin. Energy production via the Abnormality increased by 12%.<br>
	Employee REDACTED was assigned to confess a Level 2 sin. Energy production via the Abnormality increased by 15%.<br>
	We assigned employee REDACTED to confess a Level 3 sin. 1 minute and 48 seconds after the employee was sent in, a bright flash of light was seen. The light was so bright that it could be seen outside of the Containment Unit. Immediately following the light, there was a facility-wide power outage. The phenomena lasted for 2 hours. Employee REDACTED lost 6 years of their memory.<br>
	Further experiments were canceled. Scientific ethics decree that all footage of those who participated in the experiment is to be kept sealed. However, the incident left us no choice but to review the footage of the Containment Unit."<br>
	<br>
	"Employee REDACTED: "This happened during Redacted- at around 4:00 PM. Anyways, there was a railway about 20 minutes from my house. Some of my good friends and I decided to dress as forest animals. One of us chose to go as a deer. It was a crude costume, it could hardly be called one to be honest. Just a pair of clumsily made antlers and a dark outfit with some deer-like spots on it. (Omitted)<br>

	I don't know how our ‘deer’ friend wandered into the woods. We didn't even notice he was missing for maybe an hour. We searched for him and finally found him in some bushes. We called out his name, and I'm not sure if it was from relief of finally finding us or what but he started sprinting towards us.<br>
	And that's when we heard it; the gunshots. Bang! Bang! Bang! When I came to my senses, I saw his blood splattered all the way to my feet. After that, not one of us dressed up as an animal ever again. That’s all. By the way, is this really supposed to work?"<br>

	<h3>Observation Log #4_435</h3><br>
	"Its eye sockets are empty. It is a skull after all. But I doubt it’s blind. It certainly has its gaze fixed on me, and I can somehow feel that it’s listening to me. Confessing to it does lighten my heart, admittedly."<br>

	"Afterwards, we investigated the incident in the employee’s hometown to get a better picture. We learned that a boy named Justin was shot and killed in a deer costume by hunters during hunting season. Unlike the employee’s confession, Justin was repeatedly bullied by other kids. Witnesses said they heard the kids shout “Run Justin, run!" right before the gunshot. After the incident, the kids at the scene moved out of town, and deer hunting was banned in the area."<br>

	<h3>Excerpt from Abnormality Research Log X-392</h3><br>
	"Honestly, you can’t expect all of our employees to give honest confessions to that skull. Around every one in ten employees will tend to say something that is not completely true. It’s a bit different from a lie. You can say that it’s a subconscious excuse they make.<br>
	They distort perspectives to justify their actions, even though they are aware that they should be telling the truth. Once this happens, the confession is no longer truly a confession. Yes, I’m talking about you trying to justify your tardiness for 5 minutes now!"}

	You're Bald	<br>
	"Warning: You have been hit by the baldy-bald psychological attack. If a non-bald person reads this, they’ll be granted the privilege to go bald at an extremely rapid pace. If one wants to stop this from happening, they must be assigned to work on this Abnormality. In addition, if you find 10 or more strands of hair on your pillow in the morning, it is recommended to peruse this encyclopedia article at least three times."<br>

	"Bill: I had an amazing dream today!<br>
	Brian: What, did you win the lottery or something? <br>

	Bill: When I got to work, everyone here was bald! Everyone including you! Maybe even people outside of this corporation! <br>

	Brian: Umm... I think you’ve been pretty stressed lately. Why don’t you go take counseling? <br>
	Employee Bill suffered an unfortunate accident with Singing Machine that day. Right after the incident, Abnormality Bald-is-awesome! appeared in the facility. We all cherish the memories of Bald Bill."<br>

	"If one comes in contact with the Abnormality, they will talk or write about the positive aspects of baldness for about an hour, and ultimately make themselves go bald.<br>
	If you become bald, you can save time because you don’t have to wash and dry your hair anymore, allowing you to be richer than others.<br>
	No adverse reactions will happen if a bald employee is assigned to work with the Abnormality.<br>
	The bald don’t have to worry about hair loss.<br>
	If a non-bald employee is assigned, they will shave off their own hair.<br>
	Bald people can even reflect light off their head and blind their opponents like a solar flare!<br>
	This Abnormality’s goal is to make every single human on Earth bald.<br>
	We won’t need light bulbs in our facility if there are more bald employees, because reflects off their heads. This will allow us to save a tremendous amount of our budget.<br>
	If a non-bald employee is sent to work with the Abnormality, it’ll produce less energy. <br>
	Did you know that every single noble in Europe during the Middle Ages was bald? They’d change their wig everyday!"<br>

	"We’ve just added some new rules to the company code of conduct:<br>
	If you ever spot a XXX mocking their coworker with alopecia areata, they will be labeled as a hirsute, and will be banned from using the lounge for an indefinite period.<br>
	They will also be forbidden from joining the company’s debate club Questioners of the absence of bald Barbies, the gourmet meetup Octopi over Squid, and the environmental protection group Save the Bald Eagles. (These regulations will be lifted as soon as the rulebreaker’s hair strand count goes below 1.)<br>
	Lastly, I dedicate this article to employee T.H. who is quietly taking balding medicine next to me right now.""}

	<h3><center>Excerpt from Counseling Log</center></h3><br>
	"I was on the night patrol. I didn't feel the need to pay attention to Happy Teddy since it was harmless for the most part. I just looked inside the Containment Unit to check on it. Teddy was hugging someone tightly. I thought it was (Redacted), the employee who was in charge of Teddy for a while, working late. But something was odd. I entered the unit and called (Redacted)'s name, but they didn't answer. I immediately pressed the emergency button to call in reinforcement. Turns out, (Redacted) had been in a coma for 8 hours. They were in Teddy's arms the whole time."<br>

	<h3><center>An Old Letter, Stamped with "Rejected"</center></h3><br>
	"Remember what was written in the employee manual? "Do NOT have personal feelings towards Abnormalities." At first, I didn't get what that was supposed to mean. Does it even make sense to develop any emotion toward those monsters in the first place? It's okay. They are monsters.  Between the two of us, we can call them that. 'Happy Teddy Bear' was the second Abnormality you took charge of. I guess you must’ve thought that not all Abnormalities are monstrous after seeing it. The figure of an old, abandoned teddy bear may have brought up old memories of yours. Teddy seemed to like your hugs. Yeah, it would actually produce more energy when you were around. And in no time, they put you in charge of Teddy. You probably felt some kind of responsibility for it, right? I started getting worried as you visited Teddy's unit more and more often. It felt as if you were visiting an orphanage for volunteer work.<br>
	... It seems Teddy saw you as its new owner. Maybe you'd have been happy to hear that. But, you see, Teddy never wanted to be separate from its owner ever again.<br>
	You probably always promised that you'd return. But it couldn't understand. I heard that you miraculously survived. And that they spent an hour trying to separate you from Teddy's embrace. Though others may forget about you. I will always remember you. May there be a miracle."}

	"Each city needed to have its own unique technologies; that was the key to reinvigorating the city. There were numerous ones, but among them, one city saw advancements in technology for the replacement of body parts. It was possible to repair or augment body parts that were broken and malfunctioning, or simply undesirable. Every citizen was eligible for that treatment.<br>

He was a man filled with sorrow who used to cry a lot, so everybody believed that the surgery was a success."<br>

	"However, when he was asked about the whereabouts of the others who went with him, he just smiled without uttering a word. Before long, even at his parents' funeral, he showed no emotion. All he did after the treatment was stare out the window and talk to himself. Eventually, he hung himself on the doorknob of his house.<br>
	Some people thought that the treatment caused his troubles, but after a few days, he was completely forgotten. The city still remained a beautiful place where the emerald roads sparkled bright as ever."}

	Blue-Smocked Shepherd	<br>
	"You know what? About that "thing" connected to me. It has no life. Lifeless things always wait.<br>
	They miss the love, the cuddles, the happiness of that moment dearly. And when it fully realizes the situation it's in, it becomes a wolf.<br>
	That's when it can finally get my care and attention... What a dummy."<br>
	An aberration of F-01-57 that takes the form of a blue shepherd who supposedly guides rather than hunts.<br>
	Though they carry the same threatening presence, the Abnormality wields a staff instead of F-01-57's weapons with the sole intention of killing.<br>
	The staff reflects this Abnormality's nature; though they have an aura of wisdom, they are entirely capable of causing the same amount of damage as F-01-57 with a sharpened blade underneath the wood.<br>
	The blood-stained bandages and empty eye socket should be a first-time Agent's first clue that they should avoid trusting the shepherd's words, for they have seen their share of combat.<br>

	The Abnormality is a pathological liar. The problem for agents lies in the shepherd's 'wisdom', which often carries small yet heavy truths to it.<br>
	The shepherd's goal, however, is much simpler than its words entail: like most Abnormalities, it wants to be set free.<br>
	While the shepherd can prove beneficial to the facility, agents are advised to only release them when cleared by the manager: no one knows if they will act as a shepherd or cause bloodshed once they leave.<br>

	The following contains information that employees of every level should note.<br>
	However, when the shepherd knows of the presence of their old pet, the situation will change drastically.<br>
	The shepherd's egomania will grow to the point of having a sadistic pleasure from the idea of their dog rampaging as the 'wolf' it was meant to be.<br>
	This will escalate with the aspiring wolf until the two cause serious collateral damage, so it is advised to work with the two to maximize output and minimize security risk.<br>
	In this case, one could say the only counter to an abusive relationship is one of trust.<br>

	"It only waits for me, so I'm free to neglect it all I like. Throw it away until I remember it, and when it crosses my mind, I kick it again- toss it, adore it, then burn it with fire.<br>
	That's how you love a lifeless thing. It will never receive the blessing of death and farewell, either. Sad, ain't it?"}

	An aberration of F-02-58 that takes the form of a small dog rather than a large wolf. It resembles a stuffed animal in both size and appearance, with the notable difference of being able to communicate.<br>
	Unlike F-02-58, however, this Abnormality often shows no immediate sign or will to cause harm to employees. When it does, however, it suffers from far more pain than it had inflicted, making this Abnormality fairly easy to manage.<br>

	The day of <Redacted> where the facility received the shepherd was an alerting event for many employees. Even when kept far apart, the dog's agony and self-loathing spiraled out of control as the shepherd mocked and abused it from afar.<br>
	Prevent the two from meeting at all costs. Considering the potential damage it may cause, employees who can tolerate the dog's words of sorrow might find solace in holding the dog to try and calm it down.<br>

	Their body seared with pain, but it was a pain they had already gotten used to. It hurt, but the pain just meant that they were one step closer to receiving their master's affection again.<br>
	Every movement from the color blue caught their eye in the hopes that they'd be praised and rewarded, but it only brought them more agony. They waited for the master's recognition, but only a 'wolf' was worthy of the scars on its body.<br>

	There may be lots of stories here, but no story is as admirable as the wolf's role. It was a sin that it wasn't a wolf. No one cared about a toy that made funny noises. It had to be the master's wolf, not some pet.<br>
	It was raised bruised, beaten, and scarred to become a monster. Wolves could receive their master's recognition. Wolves could be petted and played with. And wolves wouldn't be punished. Wolves had always been an example. Anything less would never be loved by anyone... (Omitted)"}

	"For despair wears down the mind and drains one's will to go forward. When one feels there's nothing left to go for, their soul falls down to Hell, the Devil's domain.

	With the last bullet gone for good, the hunter traveled to numerous worlds. Sometimes he helped those in need or fought evil, but it was all done on impulse, not a gesture of goodwill or ideals. In one world, he was called a righteous hunter, while in another, he was a bloodstained gunman.."<br>

	"Date: XX/XX/XXXX<br>
	Employee M1840 went missing in the company. 2 days later, on the XXth, part of a corpse was found inside the ‘Singing Machine’. Genomic analysis revealed that the corpse belonged to the missing employee. The employee was a new hire who had only worked for the company for 3 months, and they had no record of an assignment to work with the Abnormality.<br>
	The culprit was found to be employee <Redacted>, who was in charge of the ‘Singing Machine’. <Redacted> confessed after extensive investigation. “I know it's crazy, but I had to hear that music again. It was stuck in my head for months. I performed all kinds of experiments.<br>
	When the machine takes in a cat, it plays for 1 minute, a large dog, 2 minutes and 30 seconds. But nothing could compare to the music it makes when it eats a human.<br>
	...It might sound ridiculous, but I feel satisfied, having heard it once more."}

	"A mechanical Abnormality capable of walking on its own."<br>

	"Someone's persistent gaze can be felt from the keyhole inside the machine. It blinks, but never closes. The purpose of the eye or what it is observing is unknown."<br>

	"After several experiments, it has been discovered that when one or more employees stare at the Abnormality, the condition becomes far worse."<br>

	<h3>Experiment D-002</h3><br>
	"An employee was sent in after covering their eyes with a thick cloth. The cloth must be made from a fine opaque material. Tests must be conducted to ensure the cloth completely blocks their vision. After entering the Abnormality's Containment Unit, they faced the direction of the Abnormality for 10 seconds. No reaction."<br>

	<h3>Experiment D-003</h3><br>
	"Similar to Experiment D-002, an employee was sent in with their eyes covered. The cloth was identical to the one used in D-002, but allowed the employee to discern some forms.<br>
	After entering the Containment Unit of the Abnormality, they faced towards the Abnormality for 10 seconds. After 5 seconds, it aggressively approached the employee. Experiment halted."<br>

	<h3>Experiment D-004</h3><br>
	"This time, a blind employee* was sent in without any covering. The employee faced the Abnormality for more than 30 seconds. There was no reaction.<br>
	*Please dispose of the subject used in D-004 immediately."<br>

	Memo:<br>
	When training employees who have never worked with this Abnormality before, it goes without saying, but please make sure to tell them not to look at the Abnormality directly. If someone raises doubts about this, tell them what happened to employee Yumi, who didn't follow instructions and stared directly at the Abnormality.<br>

	Memo 2:<br>
	Employee Yumi can no longer be in charge of this Abnormality. She claims that she is under constant surveillance, but this is a preposterous accusation and we believe that she has a severe delusional disorder. Most of what she says is nonsense, but to put it simply, she claims that someone keeps watching her, whether she's eating or going to the restroom. Also, whenever she sees something like a keyhole or a crack between a door, she will become hysterical and try to seal any hole that she sees. However what's more aggravating is that her mental corruption levels read normal, which makes it difficult for us to dispose of her by the system. Please replace her soon…<br>

	Memo 3:<br>
	Oh, the request we made before was resolved. Employee Yumi was found in her room. She covered all the holes in her room with duct tape, including the vent. She even stabbed her eyes out with a pen. The delusional disorder seems to have been resolved as well; she's not muttering nonsense anymore... However, I have to wonder why you would want to send a blind employee to the Containment Unit again. I don't know what Experiment D-004 is about, but I don't think it will do much good...}

	You Must Become Strong	<br>
	A mysterious worn-out machine used for operations. This machine was designed to pull back the skin and destroy bone and muscle tissue safely and efficiently. Upon further analysis, it appears to have some degree of sentience when compared to its counterpart machine. While the counterpart focuses on improving the mind, this machine focuses on the body."<br>

	"Many of those who underwent an operation inside the machine have found themselves invigorated and healthy again. Those who answered “Yes” to the question “Do you love your City?” were allowed to become strong. Those who answered “No” had to become strong. The longer the machine is in use, the stronger a person becomes. Furthermore, the longer it is used, the more a person's body would fall in line with the machine's idea of strong."<br>

	<h3><center>Excerpt from Counseling Log</center></h3><br>
	"Yeah, I'll admit it. It was really stupid of me to try and take a selfie next to the damn machine. I don't know, it just was kinda stationary? I didn't think it'd suddenly turn on when I leaned my elbow on it...<br>
	But hey, I don't think it was all that bad. I know I was screaming like hell and the pain was unbearable, but once the machine let go, it was just... done. Couldn't feel anything. Now my arm feels lighter, yet more durable.<br>
	Okay, I didn't know that was how <Redacted>'s skull was going to react to me punching him. He deserved it for grabbing me when I told him to knock it off and all, but I didn't think I'd punch him so... hurtily.<br>
	Still, even though I don't know my own strength, this arm's pretty cool."<br>

	<h3><center>Urgent Report of the Incident related to You Must Become Strong</center></h3><br>
	"We’ve filed this urgent report due to the repeated use of You Must Become Strong's limb augmentations. Due to their excessive use causing avoidable damage, as well as unpredicted behaviors from the machine, we are now requiring clearance from the Manager before anyone can receive the Abnormality's augments. If anyone is caught with an unpermitted augmentation from the Abnormality, they will be subject to termination even in the case of negligence or accident."<br>

	<h3><Warning>  Only employees Level 3 and higher are permitted to read this document.</h3><br>
	"(This recording contains a call from the Containment Unit’s emergency phone. Phone systems are installed in every room of Abnormalities of Risk Level HE or higher to enable quick threat response.)<br>
	Employee: Breach detected! I'm entering the containment unit right now!... What the?<br>
	???: Ah. Ah. Highly excited!!! / Ahh~ Thoroughly amusing!!! / Da GAME of DEATH! (Three of the same voice can be heard speaking at different times.)<br>
	Employee: The hell are those things?<br>
	???: Strong! STRONG!!! / So excited!!! / Worktime! Worktime!<br>
	Employee: Uh... Okay... Hello, Safety department? This is the Containment Unit of 'You Must Become Strong...?'<br>
	Safety: Hello, this is the Safety department, Agent (Redacted) speaking. What’s the problem?<br>
	Employee: I, uh... how do I explain this?<br>
	???: Breadwinning!!! / Ding ding ding! Ding ding ding! / Phone call! Phone call!!!<br>
	Safety: Have other employees gone insane?<br>
	Employee: No, I... don't think so? The containment unit hasn't been opened since the breach, and the guy who worked on it last is playing with his new arm... I think these things came out of the Abnormality.<br>
	???: Came out!? So excited!!! / Tear 'em of part! / Beat 'em to megadeath!!!<br>
	Safety: We'll respond immediately. Please defend yourself as needed.<br>
	Employee: Yeah, uh, I think I'm just gonna exit- what's that sound?<br>
	Safety: What's happening?<br>
	Employee: I'm hearing some gear whirring- oh shit, they're all looking at me...<br>
	???: Dissentering! Not cool, bro!!! / Hella weak!!! / You wanna get beat!? Hurtily!?<br>
	Safety: We've just dispatched three agents to your location. They'll arrive-<br>
	Employee: Screw that, I'm getting the hell out of here!<br>
	???: PUNISHMENT TIME!!! (The three voices could be heard in unison)<br>
	Employee: Stop- Hey! Shit- Send the damn agents in! The damn things are grabbing me-<br>
	???: Grow powerful!! For realsies!? / Get to work! Get to work!<br>
	Safety: Sir, are you still there?<br>
	Employee: DOES IT SOUND LIKE I'M STILL- (The sounds of the Abnormality activating can be heard, along with the sound of the Employee's screams. The Abnormality goes quiet, as does the Employee's screaming.)<br>
	Safety: Sir?<br>
	???: Make some riches! / Huge W! / Big gains!!!<br>
	Employee: ...Sorry. I'm here.<br>
	Safety: Are you alright?<br>
	Employee: Yes. I need to get to work. I'm so busy...<br>
	Safety: Sir, please refrain from any-<br>
	(The employee hangs up the phone.)<br>
	Employee: I must become strong."<br>

	"We later found the employee completely covered in augmentations as though they had plunged their entire body into the machine. They displayed signs of hostility and had to be executed. Furthermore, we identified the subjects that emerged from the machine: big, bulky toy-like amalgamations obsessed with strength and beating employees up unless they conformed to the machine's perception. Reports on these amalgamations display mixed results: their appearance and mechanical nature imply that they are machines, but their attitude and damage reports imply that they're human- or whatever is left.<br>

	The subjects that emerged from the machine are capable of self-repair, despite their otherwise fragility. The more they repair, the stronger they get but the weaker their armor becomes. Reports agreed that the subjects could only repair a maximum of five times before shutting down. Tampering with the machine also appeared to have an effect, but this proved unreliable and should be avoided unless subduing the amalgamations becomes impossible.<br>

	The word 'strong' has many connotations, and everyone's perception of 'strong' differs. Some believe that 'strength' is a matter of will, some believe that it is a matter of courage, and some believe that it is a matter of pure, raw power. While the machine has ideas of the lattermost definition, it ultimately believes that 'strength' means to comply. To comply is to become strong. To become strong is to be rewarded with power beyond comprehension. To have power beyond comprehension means to force others into line. And when everyone is strong, everyone will be happy knowing their place."}

	Nameless Fetus	<br>
	"It takes the form of an unborn fetus. Its skin is covered in a mucous, sticky liquid.<br>
	The Abnormality’s bulged eyes are usually closed and small veins can be seen on its body here and there. It always seems unsatisfied, but what exactly it needs is undetermined. It has a great obsession with being “fed” - and if it is not “fed” regularly - its stress levels rise drastically. Once it reaches a certain level of stress, it cries out loudly in way that mentally harms all who may be around it."<br>

	<h3><center>Excerpt from Interview Log #2-49</center></h3><br>
	Employee F2706: I’ve never seen it smile. It always seems to want something, but we can never fulfill its desire. I guess the reason why its cries are destructive is ‘cause its unsatisfied needs are so strong. When I was a newbie here, none of my colleagues would tell me what exactly we fed it.<br>
	I thought it was just some weird milk or something like what other normal babies would eat up. It is a baby after all underneath all that grossness. But that wasn’t the case. It only eats human flesh. Can you believe it? To stop it from crying, we have to hold a drawing every so often. Do you know what that means?<br>

	<h3><center>Excerpt from a Terminated Observation Log</center></h3><br>
	"When I first heard that the ‘Nameless Fetus’ had to be fed, I thought we’d have to give it food with like, a spoon or something. It looked too weak to do anything, and its mouth isn’t fully developed either. Later when I found out that it ate meat, I thought it’d have to be chewed up by someone first so it would be soft enough to eat. When I asked my working buddy about it, he laughed and said: “No way, that’s ridiculous. We just need to leave the food in the unit and go.”<br>
	I still thought about how in the world that fetus could eat stuff. I wondered if we served it some kinda succulent steak that’s not even available to us in the cafeteria. Out of curiosity, I decided to sneak a peek at the feeding process of the ‘Nameless Fetus’. Only level 3 and up employees are assigned to that process, but I was able to attend cause I made up an excuse that I was covering for someone.<br>
	As I nervously watched, wondering if my lie would be worth it, some people came along with large plastic bags. Does it eat that much? And when they opened the bags, I could only gape in horror. They were human corpses. And the baby ate it. How? I don't even want to imagine it. It had a large scar on its stomach; I really thought it was some kind of scar. Like a large flower, its stomach would open, dripping with slimy liquid. It was the greediest creature in the world. That day onward, I was a vegetarian."<br>

	<h3><center>Excerpt from an Employee’s Diary</center></h3><br>
	"I'm Pauly. I've worked for Lobotomy for about a month now. My parents are really proud of me for getting into a Wing like this, and all my friends are jealous of me. I still make a lot of mistakes, but someday, I'll be as capable as my coworkers."<br>
	There's a special employees-only event held by our company. No one knows when or why this event is held. Even my coworker who’s been here for 5 years doesn’t seem to know. When the event starts, a giant roulette begins to spin. Everyone stops what they're doing to stare at the roulette and see who'll be the lucky winner, with desperate looks on their faces. The name of every single employee is written on that roulette. Whoever ends up being selected, they're extremely lucky. They'll be promoted and transferred to another branch of the company, "Headquarters".<br>
	In addition, their family will be gifted with an unimaginable fortune. At the headquarters, you don’t have to worry about being attacked by Abnormalities, or need to bid farewell to your dead colleagues. My senior, (Redacted), really hopes that they’ll get picked eventually. You see, their father got into an accident one day, and it takes a lot of money to keep him alive and well. I really hope the roulette picks (Redacted) someday."<br>

	"When my senior's name showed up on the roulette, I congratulated them with all my heart. Though, they didn’t seem too happy for some reason. Others gave them a hug, one by one. Everyone was crying for some reason. They said goodbye to me, shedding tears while trying to force a smile. I haven't seen them since. I’m sure they’re working under much better conditions with a really nice salary!<br>
	But, when I try to bring them up in conversation, people stop talking as if I've spoken some sort of taboo. I still remember the last thing they said to me before they left. “One day you'll understand. The meaning of the desperation on their faces when the roulette spins.” "<br>

	"The manager holds the specific right to call a special event for all the employees in the facility without any cause for occasion. When the event starts, a giant roulette will spin and select one lucky employee’s name. That employee will be promoted, transferred to a different branch, and their family will receive a yearly pension. No personnel are allowed to invade the manager’s right to hold this event. The following information is forbidden to the public eye:<br>

	<h3>Conditions required to hold the event</h3><br>
	- Data Access Restricted<br>
	- Data Access Restricted<br>
	- The crying of ‘Nameless Fetus’ has reached its peak.<br>

	<h3>The roulette will select an employee that satisfies one of the conditions below</h3><br>
	1. Questions the true purpose of the company.<br>
	2. Conducts or plans unauthorized^ experiments with the Abnormalities.<br>
	3. Maintains an excessive curiosity about the Abnormalities, and conducts or plans unauthorized^ observation on them.<br>
	4. Is incapable of working due to physical or psychological trauma.<br>
	^ “Unauthorized” signifies that it is “Unauthorized by the corporation or Angela”.<br>

	<h3>The following actions will be taken with the employee selected by the roulette</h3><br>
	1. Expunging all records the company has about the employee.<br>
	2. Sacrificing the employee to the Abnormality.<br>
	3. Informing the employee’s family that they have been transferred to another branch."}

	Standard Training Dummy Rabbit	<br>
	"An Abnormality in the shape of a training dummy used to train up-and-coming managers."<br>

	"Rumor has it this Abnormality was chosen to be used for training as it is the most docile and tame of any that we have extracted. It’s called a training dummy “rabbit”, but it doesn’t seem to enjoy carrots. It likes people.<br>
	If it escapes, it is merely following the employee as they leave its Containment Unit."<br>

	<h3><center>Warning: Only authorized personnel are permitted to read this document.</center></h3><br>

	"What happens to the employees that die in this company? We always say the standard: gather them up on off hours, cremate the remains, clean any stains, and inform families of their retirement. However, that's not always the case. Some bodies can still be useful even after death.<br>

	We predetermine what we do with an employee's body from the very moment they fill out their mental aptitude test. Some employees who we determine to have eccentric qualities such as 'empathy' and 'kindness' become a part of our training dummy regimen. When they die, their bodies become a part of our legion of training dummy Abnormalities. The process in which we change them from cadaver to rabbit is only designated to be known by higher classification, but we'll assure you it's nothing to concern yourself about.<br>

	A corpse is, unfortunately, a useless thing. After years of life in service, a person dies and ceases all useful functions. Here, however, they can be something that is very few and far between in the City: a helper to someone in desperate need of training. We cannot in confidence call it a 'friend', but it certainly comes close. The Abnormality's kindness is pure with no darker intentions as most Abnormalities have.<br>

	Be mindful that employees should be encouraged to not get too attached when training on this Abnormality. We are here to collect energy, not something as impractical as friendship."}

	"Our proud employee, Peter, entered the Abnormality’s Containment Unit one day. When he shone the flashlight on the floor, small little spiders skittered away from the light."<br>

	"When Peter squashed one of the spiderlings by accident, a giant spider descended from the ceiling. Peter was dragged to the ceiling in only a moment. The cocooned employee hanging off the ceiling of the Containment Unit will be a healthy meal for the spider's offspring."<br>

	"Unsurprisingly, not a single employee volunteered to retrieve the corpse of their cocooned colleague."<br>

	<h3><center>Excerpt from an Animal Encyclopedia</center></h3><br>
	"...A fact often overlooked by many is that victims trapped in a spider's cocoon are actually not dead. The prey is in fact slowly dying within. Their death is postponed so they can be kept fresh for later consumption. A spider's poison contains a toxin that permanently damages the heart, eventually leading to death. Insects, trapped in the pitch-black cocoons, have no choice but to wait for the spiderlings to feed on them, feeling their heart beat slower and slower. (Omitted)"<br>

	<h3><center>Excerpt from the Head of the Welfare Department's Letter</center></h3><br>
	"We do appreciate your suggestion. However, our own research indicates that your concerns are unlikely to be true. Furthermore, it is proven that the presence of a cocoon in the Containment Unit increases the energy output. For these reasons, we will not implement a rescue procedure for employees who are caught by Spider Bud as it is against our interests. However, we will allocate more resources into researching this specimen in the future per your opinion. Please be advised that disrupting the atmosphere of our workspace by spreading unconfirmed rumors is against the code of conduct, and may even be subject to penalties including dismissal. Lobotomy always values the welfare and voices of its employees. - Head of the Welfare Department, Lobotomy Corporation."<br>

	"There's an eerie rumor spreading among employees. It's not out of the ordinary for a rumor or two to spread in a company like this, but it is interesting that the number of alleged witnesses seems to multiply.<br>

Because of this, employees often speculate that the matchstick may be the Abnormality's true body. However, recently, the ashen figure was seen crying, according to witnesses."<br>

	<h3><center>Excerpt from Abnormality Specialist Doctor REDACTED's Research Log</center></h3><br>
	"The charred body represents the child's crumbled hope, while the ever blazing flame represents the obsession for affection. It's always in conflict with the contradiction between these two."<br>

	"Well, she’s like a ticking time bomb. No one can tell if she’s in a good mood or not. We just hope that we won’t be the one blown up before entering the Containment Unit. She won’t get any better, we can only try and keep her from getting worse."<br>

	<h3><center>Excerpt from Counseling Log</center></h3><br>
	"I never thought the abnormality would be able to escape. Maybe we were getting careless, but it seemed that all it could do was burn up the match stuck in its body. Yes, our response was a bit late. (Omitted)<br>
	Most Abnormalities that try to escape would attack the employees in front of them, but this one didn't show any aggression toward the nearby employees. Instead, it headed to a different department, the most crowded place in the company. If we didn't suppress it at the door, half of the people here wouldn't be in one piece."}

	Fragment of the Universe	<br>
	"An Abnormality that resembles a child's innocent doodles. Originally, it had no stable form, its shape would continually morph. To this day its aspects still change, albeit at a much slower pace. Component analysis has revealed that the Abnormality consists of matter that does not exist on Earth. It is notable for its metaphysical appearance that one cannot explain with words."<br>

	"It often shows incomprehensible linguistic activity. One employee tried to decipher its speech (see Document #1 <Employee David’s Song>), but their mental contamination level rose beyond the limit within several days. They suffered severe psychosis and had to be quarantined."<br>

	"The Abnormality's tentacles (which are quite different from what we consider the average tentacle; for simplicity’s sake we’ve monickered them as “tentacles”) can pierce through the barrier of humanity. Employees impaled by the tentacles will suffer semi-permanent brain damage."<br>

	"When the Abnormality escapes its Containment Unit, it will emit noises in the corridor. As the sounds it makes have what could be considered a melody and syllables, we consider it “singing”. However, none of our staff can precisely remember it, given that most of the time they are unable to describe it due to their serious brain damage. Those who were within 100 meters of the “singing” called it a sound unheard of in this world. Because of these descriptions, we’ve titled it “Echoes from the Beyond”. (See Document #2 <Singing>)"<br>

	<h3><center>Experiment_1 - The Possibility of Communication</center></h3><br>
	"We have determined that the Abnormality has an intelligence similar to (or even higher than) that of humans, and gave it a simple language learning course. As a result, a crude communication by combining words has become possible. The following is a segment of the communication record with the Abnormality.<br>

	Q: Are all of your kind similar in appearance?<br>
	A: Negative. Outside. Child. See. Picture. Face. Happy. Change. Form.<br>

	Q: Why have you come here?<br>
	A: Knowledge. Share. Human.<br>

	Q: Why do you want to share your knowledge with us?<br>
	A: Understanding. Knowledge. Moment. Know. Universe. Coincidence. Negative; None.<br>

	This section is an attempt to decipher the conversation with the Abnormality.<br>
	1. It based its form on a picture drawn by a child. It changed its form because the child's expression while drawing it was happy.<br>
	2. It came here to share its species’ knowledge with us. The moment we fully understand that knowledge, we will know their ultimate goal.<br>
	3. There is no such thing as a coincidence in the universe."<br>

	<h3><center>Experiment_2 - An Experiment on Laughter</center></h3><br>
	"After watching a video about laughing for 30 minutes, the Abnormality understood the concept of “laughing”. After that, when employees entered its Containment Unit to work with it, it would sometimes emit a strange noise with what appeared to be the shape of a smile on its face. It looked like it was mimicking laughter."<br>

	<h3><center>Experiment_3 - Comprehension of Symbols</center></h3><br>
	We taught it the meaning of various symbols along with language. Among them was the shape of a heart. This symbol provoked a distinct change from the Abnormality.<br>

	Q (Showing the Abnormality a picture of a heart): This is the symbol of the “heart”. Many people believe that emotions come from the heart, and this symbol is used to express positive emotions or a liking towards someone. (Omitted)<br>

	Afterwards, several symbols resembling hearts were seen on the Abnormality’s body. It seemed to understand that the symbol could be used to express friendliness towards humans. Combining the results of the previous two experiments, we can confirm that this Abnormality is non-hostile to humans, and wishes to become friends."<br>

	<h3><center>Document #1 - Employee David’s Song</center></h3><br>
	"David was famous in his department for his attempts to communicate with the 'Fragment of the Universe'. He was an intellectual who enjoyed reading philosophical books and gazing at the stars. He held interest in the Abnormality and as such he got the job; he researched its language and behaviour purely out of personal interest.<br>
	So what became of David? Eventually, he succeeded in entering the domain of the Fragment of the Universe. However, it was obvious that his small brain couldn't withstand it. He was transferred to the psychiatric ward, and died of starvation while singing an unrecognizable song. This is why the Abnormality’s voice cannot be revealed to the public.<br>

	<h3><center>Document #2 - Singing</center></h3><br>
	"...Why didn't you tell me earlier that the Abnormality was responsible for their condition? I have no idea if there’s any pattern, but they all show the same strange behavior on the exact same days. Can you imagine a group of patients staring at the sky with dazed faces, wailing strange noises in the corridor at night while everyone is asleep? I had such a difficult time persuading the other patients that they must have been practicing for the company’s upcoming Halloween event. Psychiatric treatment and medicine won't help.<br>
	"Coming, coming, still coming," they keep repeating these words, and anything else they utter is not from any language we know. I think sending them to a general hospital was an unwise decision.<br>

	Note: There have been rumors of employees pretending to put on the armor for fun. Please look into this immediately!"<br>

	"This armor was secured from a museum. The information below is the fragments of its legend.<br>
	…This armor once belonged to General XXXX, who joined the War of XX during the year of XXX. It was a family heirloom, passed down through many generations. The general always wore this armor to keep himself protected. By a stroke of bad luck however, an arrow flew into a gap in the armor, killing him instantly. Somehow, the armor was undamaged.<br>
	After the death of General XXXX, the armor was presented to Commander XXX of Battalion 00. The commander was always seen steel-clad each time he set out into battle. During one of his battles, the commander fell from his horse while fleeing from the enemy and died due to a fatal injury upon his skull. Still, the armor once again remained undamaged. There are many others throughout this armor’s history who have had their hands on it, and each and every one of them has died in battle. Meanwhile, the armor still kept its pristine condition.<br>
	Over the years, the armor made its way to a warrior named XXX. He was known for simply keeping the armor in storage, not wearing it for a single battle. Eventually, XXX died of old age after participating in dozens of wars without sustaining a single injury. During his lifetime, the armor’s right arm became damaged, but there was no sign of exterior impact. XXX’s family later donated the armor to a museum."<br>

	"After running a few tests on the armor, we have come up with the following conclusions: If this armor is worn by a cowardly employee, their chances of fatal injury and death are drastically increased. Inversely, when an employee who holds no fear of death wears it, their chances of injury and death are exceedingly decreased."<br>

Unbearable depression overwhelms all who look into the bath. In an instant, it can pull a nearby person into it. It bears no considerable strength, but those who suffer from its crushing depression do not resist. It devours the victim until nothing remains except for their wrists. All the hands which float in the bath are pale, exsanguinated; they stretch into the air and reach out as if asking for help."<br>

	"It is no easy feat to cut one’s wrist with a sane mind. A strong will is needed with the resolve to make multiple attempts. Only when it is sliced as if one were simply cutting a mere slab of meat, can they achieve this. Only when one yearns for death that much, can they succeed."<br>
	"I eternally regret not realizing to ask her why she needed that industrial knife. I eternally regret not realizing that she was hiding her wrists with long sleeves. I eternally regret not realizing that she always took extra care to hide them whenever I spoke with her. I eternally regret not realizing that I never heard her cheerful laughter anymore, and that she roamed around the company with lifeless eyes more and more often."<br>

	"We always popped open a bottle of wine every time we succeeded. It became one of our customs. She told us that it only takes one slight misstep to fall into indifferent habit if we get too used to success. Thus, we should always smile, rejoice, and celebrate every little thing in the wake of success. And we should never neglect failure, as success can be born from a pile of failures.

	By this incident. He’ll only eat 5kg of his favorite snack now. To help him cope with the trauma, I suggest we request a new snack for Ppodae: “Premium grade salmon rich with Vitamin B”. I’ll be waiting for your reply."<br>

	Today's Shy Look	<br>
	"It's a good day! Are you still shy today?"<br>

	"One sunny day, when they were sincerely drying the laundry in the yard, sadness struck suddenly.<br>

	“In our city, sacrifices for corporates must be highly praised. Honor for their deaths. No reason for you to cry either. Rather, you should be glad.”<br>

	“What's with that look on your face? That kind of facial expression isn't recommended in our city.”<br>

	“Goodness, why are you making such a face? You're making others feel gloomy too. Please be more considerate, you don't live in this world alone after all.”<br>

	“You are very poor at expressing your emotions. You must be quite shy.”<br>

	“Hey, try to look more pleased, that way those living in the Outskirts will be more envious of us.”<br>

	“Put a bigger smile on your face! It's not that hard.”<br>

	“Next time, try to express yourself more clearly, it's very important to express oneself in this society.”<br>

	One sunny day, just like that day they sincerely dried the laundry, they dried their own skin."<br>

	"Everyone was finally satisfied when they showed a bright smile. If they met people who asked what was wrong, they would respond: “I'm just shy, that's all. Just shy...”"<br>

	"If one tries to look at the face behind the skin, the result will not be pretty. The space behind their skin is the only personal space they have left. Leaving it uninvaded is the last bit of generosity the City can offer."}

	Grave of Cherry Blossoms	<br>
	"A tree that stands in the middle of the Containment Unit. It never withers even if it is not given any form of nutrition. Some employees take time to rest near this tree. Employees sometimes enter its Containment Unit for leisure."<br>

	"Pansy: Hey Xavier, did you see that new Abnormality? I think you got put in charge of it.<br>
	Xavier: Yeah, I saw it alright. Just some tree with buds along its branches. I don’t think they’ll be able to blossom without sunlight.<br>
	Pansy: Did you start making observations and writing reports yet?<br>
	Xavier: Nah, I think I’ll get to it soon enough, though.<br>
	Pansy: Alrighty, take care."<br>

	"Pansy: Heya, long time no see. How’s it going lately?<br>
	Xavier: Yo, get this! Y’know that Abnormality we talked about before? I don’t think it’s hostile. And guess what? It started blooming! It was so surreal looking at them, it felt like spring had come for the first time in this place.<br>
	Pansy: Is that okay? Usually, any sort of change is a bad omen for something catastrophic here.<br>
	Xavier: Don’t worry, it’s just some harmless little flowers. Thanks for worrying about me though."<br>

	Pansy: Bonjour again. How’s work been going for you?<br>
	Xavier: Golly, the flowers just keep blooming. I think it’ll fill up the whole unit at this rate. You should see it for yourself. It’s really beautiful. I don’t think I’d ever get sick of looking at it.<br>
	Pansy: I’d love to, man, but I can’t. I’ve been so busy lately.<br>
	Xavier: Really? Damn, what a shame... It’s absolutely magnificent, I’m telling ya.<br>
	Pansy: Hmm... You doing alright by the way? You’ve been making a lotta mistakes these days... It seems like you’ve been spacing out a ton too.<br>
	Xavier: Don’t worry, it’s nothing. I gotta head back now. Oh, I’ve been making a sketch of the tree, actually. I’ll let you be the first person to see it when I’m done.<br>

	<h3><center>Audio Recording of Counseling Session</center></h3><br>
	"...Yeah, I’ve been better recently. I got better at managing Abnormalities, too. Going to Grave of Cherry Blossoms’s chamber makes me feel weirdly amazing, like you said. I never believed that mumbo-jumbo about flora giving out a good aura or whatever...<br>
	But I guess it was true. It’s such a shame I can’t see those cherry blossoms with Xavier. I got to see his work in progress sketch when I was rummaging through his stuff one time. The actual tree was much more beautiful. It was more magnificent than everything he’d described it as. It’s such a tragedy that he went missing before seeing how it is now. If you find any Abnormality suspicious, please make sure you look into ‘em, alright?<br>
	...Yep, I’m fine now. I shook off that feeling. The cherry blossoms all fell after I saw it that time. Yet, I saw buds poking out of the branches again... Would it be alright if I oversaw the Abnormality from now on? No, it’s no big deal. I just wanna see those flowers in full bloom again. Yes, thank you."<br>

	<h3><center>Notice of Advice</center></h3><br>
	"We’ve received reports about an alarming increase in the number of employees who want to view Grave of Cherry Blossoms’s containment. This fervent rush of requests is likely due to the absence of natural scenery in our facility. However, I don’t think there is any need to make a rule against it. We’ve found that our staff’s mental contamination indices decreased when looking at Grave of Cherry Blossoms.<br>
	The reason behind this is unimportant. It could be “flora giving out a good aura” for all anyone cares. The only thing that’s certain is that Grave of Cherry Blossoms captivates our employees, and they don’t know what lies beneath its roots. Did you realize that the cherry blossoms are strikingly crimson, and its unmatched beauty is caused by its color? The more blood it has, the more beautiful it is. Our employees who are oblivious to it are drawn to it again and again... Just keep everything hush-hush for now. It’s how things work in this place."}

//Penitent Girl

	Penitent Girl	<br>
	"A young girl wearing a pair of elegant red women's shoes. The design of the shoes is antique, but there is no telling where and how they were made. Upon analysis, these shoes are identical to the Abnormality known to tempt employees. However, the girl's severed feet remain affixed inside the shoes, making them unwearable."<br>

	"The Abnormality's mind was once overwhelmed with the urge to try the shoes on. The changes that occured resulted in her appearance today, with hair that covers her forlorn expression. She makes no attempt to stop anyone from peering at her eyes that eternally cry bloody tears, but this appearance is distressing enough to dissuade all but the most curious of employees."<br>

	<h3>Warning</h3>
	"We advise all employees to not show sympathy towards the Abnormality. That sympathy will eventually turn to empathy as weak-willed employees will cut off their feet to show the same penance. This, combined with the lack of interest in obtaining treatment, will eventually lead to death by blood loss. Everyone makes mistakes in life, with some mistakes bigger than others. However, if those mistakes do not result in your death, then we advise you to not make it as such."<br>

	"Was it wrong to enjoy simple pleasures in life when one knew what it was like to have nothing? The girl did not ask herself such meaningless questions once she put on the shoes. All that mattered was her mesmerizing dance that would stop a passerby from even the most important of tasks. Without the shoes, she would go back to being the nobody she once was. Not once did she think of the consequences... that is, until her hands tightly gripped a short red axe and the shoes were steeped in the blood of others.<br>

	In horror of what she had done, the girl begged in tears. "Mister, please cut off my feet..." The executioner obliged, and the girl's joy at having this curse removed was the only thing keeping her sane throughout the excruciating pain. Yet when she opened her eyes, when the pain was finally bearable, she found that her feet stayed with her. It was as if she still had ankles; they were just ones that weren't there. In the end, it was the knowledge that she would never be parted with the shoes, not the pain, that caused the girl's screams to ring through the heavens she would never reach."}

	Void Dream	<br>
	" 'I wished to sleep eternally.'<br>
	'So don’t bother trying to wake me up again.' "<br>

	"An Abnormality whose form sports a goat’s fur and horns. It is not unique in regards to its appearance with the exception of several colorful eyes embedded upon its body. Gaining information about this Abnormality is expected to be difficult due to its ceaseless slumber."<br>

	"The following counseling log illustrates how Void Dream’s ability to make any person slumber psychologically affects the employees. The results indicate that we cannot utilize this ability to reduce the mental corruption of our staff. Please refer to this record for further research.<br>
	Vincent: Please, make it quick... I gotta sleep...<br>
	Counselor: Is that because of the Abnormality?<br>
	Vincent: Yeah, I remember seeing something that looked like a sheep pass by me, and... well, I fell asleep. Since then I’ve been like this.<br>
	Counselor: Do you remember the dream you had back when that occurred?<br>
	Vincent: Oh, I could never forget that dream...<br>
	Counselor: Could you please tell me as much as you can about it?<br>
	Vincent: It was a happy, wonderful, sweet dream. That’s all the words I need to describe it. Heck, I even felt glad to be working for this company. And I saw a guy who’s not with me anymore, he was right next to me... (Omitted) ...Because of that I couldn't get a hold on myself when I woke up.<br>

	Counselor: I see. I’ve heard a little about you from the other employees recently. All of them say that the only thing you do outside of work hours is sleep. Could you please tell me why?<br>
	Vincent: Don’t you understand what I’m talking about? I just want to have that dream again. That dream where I was there with him. Recalling those happy moments... But I couldn’t go back no matter how many times I slept. I slept, and slept, and slept, and slept, and slept, and yet...!<br>
	Counselor: ...I see. I’d advise you to take some rest in your room.<br>
	Vincent: ...They said everyone who woke up after hearing that Abnormality’s sound went mad. People think it’s because they all had a horrible nightmare they couldn’t handle, but it’s actually the other way around. The reality they had to wake up to was so terrible that the soul gave up on waking life. As you know, time flows differently in dreams. A mere instant of waking life constitutes an eternity in the dreamworld. Maybe, if Void Dream were to put me to sleep once again, then I might just have that wonderful dream anew.<br>
	Counselor: ...I’ll prescribe you some sleep medicine. I assure you that it’ll help you sleep. Please get some rest for now. Finally, you will be prohibited from entering the Abnormality’s Containment Unit from now on."<br>

	"A demon must change its shape to deceive others. A demon must grant sweet dreams to deceive others. A crack appears in the human mind when it is shown the dream it yearns for. A demon will never miss this chance to bring one to their doom.<br>

	Don’t say such complicated things, don’t say those scary words.<br>
	I just want to grant people sweet dreams; Grant them the enrapturing dreams they want.<br>
	Those who’ve had my dreams are destined to come back to me.<br>
	So, just close your eyes..."<br>

	"In the dream, your smile was beaming, and we chatted with such liveliness. When I came back to waking life, I realized I was back in a world in which you no longer existed; I felt a void as big as that fleeting happiness I felt in my dream fill my heart.
	I closed my eyes and forced myself to sleep, but morning was still to come no matter what. I think that’s when my soul started to crumble. In fact, I was already broken since the day I parted with you, but I’ve only been acting fine. My soul was already shattering itself into fragments after the passing of that day. Once I saw you again, my yearning for you began to bear down too heavily, I couldn’t ever go back to my old self again.<br>
	Counseling... Rest... All of it was useless. I spent days by myself, agonizing until I finally realized it. It lured me with an unforgettable bait. That was the price for eating away my nightmares. And then it left me with nothing but void, so I would have no choice but to return to it. Then... I have lost to it.<br>
	I don’t want to know anything anymore.<br>
	Please, eat my dreams."}

	"Lloyd: You're located near the Information Team right? I've heard that some employees went missing around that area. Would you mind checking to see if there's any Abnormalities causing spatial interference?<br>
	Paul: What? But there's no such Abnormality around here. I don't detect any breaching Abnormalities either.<br>
	Lloyd: Look everywhere.<br>
	Paul: Well, Lloyd, there's no sign of any Abnormality, but I do see a small flower on the ground.<br>
	Lloyd: What are you on about? What flower?<br>
	Paul: The bud is glowing, it's amazing. It's strange finding something so green here, when we don't even get sunlight... It's so bright, other employees came over to look at the flower too. You need to come and see it... The light is so bright and warm... I feel like something good is about to happen...<br>
	Lloyd: ...That's not a flower. Order all the employees nearby to evacuate immediately. Do not run away in a group; you have to slowly escape one by one, with quiet steps...<br>
	Paul: What are you talking about, I thought I told you there's nothing nearby... Wait, I think I just felt a slight tremor beneath my feet. Is someone fixing the pipes today?<br>
	Lloyd: Ah, screw it. Just enjoy looking at that flower all you want..."}

	The Lady Facing the Wall	<br>
	"An Abnormality in the shape of a woman against the wall. Over time, her unbearable sorrow grew into a mournful obsession, covered in countless, lengthy hairs."<br>
	"As she is always facing the wall, not a single person has seen her face. While she occasionally talks to herself and weeps quietly, it is impossible to have a meaningful conversation with her. Despite her human appearance, it is impossible to discern what she is really looking at or her true intentions."<br>
	"She will attempt to talk to or pique the interest of those who are about to leave her Containment Unit. However, one should never look back in response, as it may cause mental damage. Certain rumors insist that one may turn to stone upon looking back, but this is clearly not true."<br>

	<h3><center>Excerpt from Observation Log 1-304</center></h3><br>
	"There is only one important rule to follow: Ignore her. She always tries to draw our attention. She mutters incoherently in an attempt to have those in the room pay closer attention to what she’s saying. She’ll even plead or whisper maliciously when someone is about to leave in the hopes that they may instinctively look back. The subconscious is a threat to your own health in her presence; it is important to have your guard up and to be aware of what is occurring when you are in the room with her. If you forget the warnings for even a second and let your guard down, you may find yourself looking back towards here. I have another warning to leave to all who read this: Do not let this insidious Abnormality learn your name. If she learns your name, she may use it to trick you into turning around. No matter what you hear or what she may do to tempt you while you are in the room with her, DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT under any circumstance look at her. Curiosity is a luxury you must NEVER indulge in when you are in her Containment Unit."<br>

	<h3><center>Excerpt from Counseling Log #9-39</center></h3><br>
	"Employee F5004: <Redacted> was a colleague of mine for whom I cared deeply. Well, I cared for all my coworkers, but <Redacted> was different. The amount of passion they poured into their work was something I have rarely witnessed in life. Anyways, I have no idea how she, that Abnormality, learned <Redacted>’s name. Maybe someone called it out to them while they were inside the Containment Unit and she heard it. We should have sent two in for work with her. The common procedure was to have a team of two sent into the Containment Unit, but as you know, we’re always shorthanded. Besides, that Abnormality was low on the threat scale. If we followed the procedure and sent two inside, the powers that be would not have been happy about it one bit. (Omitted)<br>
	Well, you know the rest. The day the incident happened, <Redacted> was sent to the Containment Unit as usual, but they didn’t come out for a long time. I know <Redacted> was a prompt and diligent worker, so I headed straight for the Containment Unit fearing the worst. Thankfully, I found them without even a scratch, but the kid looked out of it. Like, way out of it. (Omitted)<br>
	The next day, the kid was resigned. I heard they sent ‘em to an asylum, but no one ever saw <Redacted> again. The kid just kept staring at the wall, murmuring and not responding to anyone. That was the very last time I saw <Redacted>. No one knows what happened inside the Containment Unit. You won’t find it out from the kid either."}

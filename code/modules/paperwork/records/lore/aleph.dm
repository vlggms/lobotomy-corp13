Recently, however, we have received reports that there are group activities plotting unhealthy schemes. Due to constant allegations, we cannot help but take notice of the matter. It is against the company's rules to idolize and/or worship certain Abnormalities. Nothing is allowed to be "sacred" in this place.<br>
	Employees that try to enter the Containment Units of specific Abnormalities without authorization will face punishment. Especially if they are not in charge of said Abnormalities. If you feel an impulse to throw yourself into a certain Abnormality, that means you are "infected". It means that it is in the process of manipulating and dazzling your brain, as do other Abnormalities in this place. If this happens, please stop whatever you are doing and seek immediate mental treatment. As you have all passed basic employee training, we hope no one will be foolish enough to be misled."<br>

Those who are on this list must take 3 days of mental treatment provided by the company and will receive punishment accordingly by their respective Sephirah. We are making this list public to bring your attention to the astonishing number of infected employees around you.<br>
	Please note: Calling Emily—who killed herself after breaking into the Containment Unit of a certain Abnormality—a “martyr” will be treated as noncompliance with the company’s rules.<br>
	On a side note, we would like to praise employee Dylan's courageousness in his rescuing of employee Sophie, who was about to throw herself into a certain Abnormality. If you see any of your valuable colleagues displaying this kind of behavior, please promptly report it to the Sephirah in charge."<br>

	<i>I don't believe you turned Sophie and us over deliberately. I'm sure you were just worried about Sophie. She's locked up now. I heard that she repeatedly tried to escape, so they tied her to the bed. Tell me, is it wrong to have faith?</i><br>
	<i>We are all sinners, and our Blue Star is the only sanctuary that accepts us. We will be cleansed of our sins there. We all go back to that place someday. This is an instinct. You thought Emily died when she threw herself into the Star, but she simply returned to her rightful place. She's a martyr. She has become an eternal star. The rise of a star is a brand new beginning.</i><br>

	"An Abnormality whose appearance resembles a human, but cannot and should not be human. It periodically devours employees and wears their shell. The skeleton and organs are misplaced during the process, so it takes a bizarre form."<br>

	"The Abnormality does have a tongue, however, it has no knowledge of speech and as such cannot talk; it can only make meaningless sounds. There is no telling what is inside its shell, but its skin continuously wears down, so there is a need to change and maintain the outer layer. It is insensible to pain; it may break its own bones or cut itself up to escape through a small crevice."<br>

	"Bit by bit, we discovered that this Abnormality may be evolving. It demonstrates behaviour similar to the character of the person who used to be its shell. It even makes attempts to equate itself with human beings."<br>

	"When it escapes, it wears the skin of the person it killed and mimics them. Then, without any sign or forewarning, it reveals its true/second form. In its true/second form, its resemblance is much similar to that of humanity in comparison to its earlier form. The new form is confirmed to possess bipedalism, properly aligned organs, and the addition of greater physical strength. All the employees are afraid of this form."<br>

	"Just like how we observe Abnormalities as employees, ‘Nothing There’ observes us. Then it puts on the shell of an employee and thinks of itself as the employee that just died. The sight of that thing eating one of us is horrifying beyond words, just trying to think about it might drive me mad. Heading to its containment to check the state of its shell is a toil on your mind, too. Imagine that a colleague of yours who you chatted with just a few days ago is now sitting in that room, neck snapped, guts exposed, walking on all fours, drooling like a beast. (Omitted)<br>

	That’s not all. When I was still a new employee, no one else was willing to enter its Containment Unit, so I was forced to go work with it. It looked even worse than it does now. It was in the shape of a horribly deformed human. What’s worse, it tried to mimic humans. Doing stuff like looking into a mirror, mumbling to itself, or trying to fix its skeletal structure; it’s as if it was trying to mimic ‘us’. Who knows, it might get good enough to casually walk among us one day... Hey, why are you laughing? I'm being serious here!""<br>

	Employee 1: The Abnormality is attacking my colleague. It’s literally ripping them apart, I can’t do anything. I repeat, we need a weapon to control the Abnormality.<br>

	Safety: How can you be so sure?<br>

	"Just like how we observe Abnormalities as employees, ‘Nothing There’ observes us. Then it puts on the shell of an employee and thinks of itself as the employee that just died. It mimics the employee's usual behaviour, the way they talk, likes and dislikes, and every other visible trait. We can only guess how carefully, and for how long it has been observing the employees to imitate them. What I’m trying to say is, we can’t just treat it like some ‘dumb scary monster’. Even now, it could be strolling about wearing the shell of someone we know. This Abnormality is becoming more and more like a human. Its transformation is getting faster too. I get goosebumps just thinking about it. If the time comes when we fail to recognize it, that will be the day the company falls.We must stay ever vigilant when dealing with this Abnormality."<br>

	"The following is a recording of the abnormal behavior an employee exhibited in their last moments after they became a shell of ‘Nothing There’."<br>

	Employee 1: Manager, manager!<br>
	Employee 2: Man, you've been looking for the manager for quite a while now. You've been acting really weird today y'know? With that weird smile and all.<br>
	Employee 1: ...<br>
	Employee 2: Anyhow, I sure hope we get pasta in the cafeteria for dinner today. I’d love some of that with thick bacon.<br>

	Employee 1: ...<br>
	Employee 2: Hey, say somethi—<br>

	"The second employee proceeded to take immediate action upon hearing that. However, ‘Nothing There’ tore out of the shell of the first employee, revealing its beginning form. The recording only includes audio files, so what exactly happened or what kind of behavior the employee exhibited still remains a mystery. The shell with ‘Nothing There’ inside tries its best to mimic the behavior of the employee it tried to kill moments ago. The actions of the last employee it eyed, their final words, those sort of things. And the many shells cried out one word, “Manager”."}

	The Mountain of Smiling Bodies	<br>
	"It's not like these kinds of happenings are uncommon here, but one day, dozens of employees were killed in an incident. The reason is the same as always. Something breaches, they attempt to stop it, then it leads to another breach... The one fortunate thing was that the department was sealed off before things could get any worse, so they all died in the same place. Literally, a mountain of bodies was formed. Obviously, no one wanted to clean up that mess.	<br>
	Normally, it should have been taken care of within the day, but because the accident was just so horrific and everyone was so exhausted, the clean up was delayed with authorization from the department’s Sephirah. Don't ask me which department it was in, I don't remember all the details."	<br>
	<br>
	"When left out in the open, a corpse will begin to rot within a few hours. Most of the bodies that die here are damaged in one way or another, so they decay even faster. You probably don’t know it yet, but most of the employees here are rather skilled at cleaning up dead bodies. Tidying up over and over will make anyone an expert at it, whether you want to or not. Let’s say someone you were just talking to about dinner plans died horrifically. With your repeated experience to help you, you won’t be vomiting or running away at least."	<br>
	<br>
	"Whoops, I sidetracked a little there. Anyway, in normal circumstances, the mountain would have been removed quickly, but it remained in the department for quite a long time. So it decayed, melted, corroded, and broke down following the laws of nature."	<br>
	<br>
	"That's how its creation began, from the mountains of bodies. The dead gave life to something. Amazed yet? I've still got more to tell you. The dead fused with one another, all smiling. Sharing body parts, at least those that were still intact, they became each other's legs and mouths. That doesn't mean their consciousness has also been restored though. It only wants one thing: our flesh drenched in blood. When there’s an announcement of someone’s death, the first thing you should do is check if this thing’s quarantined. Once it gets a whiff of the scent, it will pursue us in an instant. The smiling faces are unfamiliar yet sorrowful. The more bodies it comes across, the more defined its shape becomes. And it is never satisfied.	<br>
	I'm telling you all this because it's almost here. Accidents always happen in this place. Some may spare a bit of their time for a moment of silence, but most will turn away thinking, "Again?". At the very least, one thing that was done right is that the department’s been sealed off. I'm the only one left anyways. Did you learn anything from my story? What kind of lesson can be learned from a story as horrible as this, you ask? It's similar to most fairy tales. "Don't be lazy" is the lesson. When my voice ceases, come here and clean up your colleagues in exactly 3 minutes"	<br>
	<br>
	"Pretty soon I won't be able to keep talking. I'm about to swallow a large bomb. Time's running out. Blood is flowing all around here. I'm starting to see the smiling faces now... Something you don't see much of around here. Don't be surprised when you hear a loud explosion. Like I said, it's precisely 3 minutes. I'm sure a bomb this size will be able to suppress it. The last body it finds will be mine."}

	The rose starts white, but we must paint its petals red. To leave the rose devoid of color is to threaten the well-being of our facility. If the rose is dissatisfied, it will shed its petals and scatter a pollen which will cause employees to cough up flower petals. This illness is currently untreatable and will persist until one of the problems is taken care of: whether it be the rose or the employee."<br>

All of the employee's records are to be expunged, and all family members and loved ones are to be informed that they have gone missing. Employees should not be allowed to investigate into the Abnormality's workings further if they know about their connection with the missing employee."<br>

	<h3><center>Excerpt from Counseling Log</center></h3><br>
	"I initially questioned this thing's authenticity as an Abnormality. Just looked like a giant rose to me, but all the superiors were freaking out about it like it was the harbinger of the end of the City as we knew it. Tried making that joke around the Department Head, and they just kinda... gave me the most nervous chuckle I've ever seen them give anyone. Weirdo.<br>

	But forget the Head, I wanna instead talk about Daisy. Daisy was the one person I could really rely on in this hellhole of a facility. Always looking out for me, saving me from whenever I'd make some stupid mistake... I always tried to help out however I could, but I was nothing compared to Daisy. Damn, I always looked up to her. That's why I started noticing when something was off.<br>

	It was little things at first, like smelling the little potted plants and drinking more water than she usually did. But then it got really out of the ordinary when she kept asking me out to go see some nature preserve in the Nest after work. I didn't mind it since it was nice and all to see something that wasn't so bleak and terrible compared to the rest of the City, but then she'd get all weird. She'd start wanting me to do things like lay in the flowerbeds with her which was kinda cute, but then after a few visits, she wanted me to actually bury her halfway in the soil. I remember I asked if she was feeling alright, and she insisted she wanted to do something like that at the Great Lake beaches but could never afford the tickets to go there. Damn it, why'd I indulge her? Dirt's so much harder to dig up than sand, anyway... yet after I buried her, she looked so at peace in the world. How could I ignore that stupid smile of hers?<br>

	It wasn't until after all these weird incidents that I learned she was working on that damned rose. I asked if I could take over work for her, she seemed like she was getting really tired and all, but every time I'd offered, Daisy would just... panic and tell me that she could take care of it. I remember one day I really pushed her, told her I could absolutely handle it, but then Daisy just started sobbing and hugging me. I still remember... "Kris, I can't lose someone as beautiful as you are." Gotta say, that memory really sticks out in my head. Shit, I still get teary-eyed thinking about it...<br>

	...Of course, that was the last time I ever saw her. But I'll be damned if I let this company pretend like nothing ever happened."<br>
	<br>
	We require that no one attempt to find Kris. We have appropriately expunged all records of Kris and informed their family members of their absence from the corporation. We also would like to take this moment to remind everyone that we require all employees to not look further into the Abnormality's data or any missing employees related to the Abnormality.<br>
	<br>
	"Today, the Department Head assigned me to work on the Staining Rose until further notice. They had that same expression of someone telling another that their loved one was dead. No one explicitly told me that Daisy was dead, but I knew damn well what that monster of a flower did to her. I'm going to find out what the hell that bastard did to Daisy, or my name isn't Krishanth Umum."}

	Melting Love	<br>
	"A melting slime with a resemblance to humans when inspected closely. Its Containment Unit is covered in its mucus secretions."<br>
	
	"Today, I’d like to talk about the recent incident everyone has heard of. That’s right, that dreadful incident when an army of slimes took over our facility for (Redacted) minutes. There were several containers left in the (Redacted) lab which were not processed properly during the experiment related to (Redacted).<br>
	
	If you know about the (Redacted) experiment, you would already know that the contents of those containers are merely useless leftovers that only prove the experiment has failed. Our researchers felt there was no need to dispose of them.<br>
	
	It was obvious that one newbie to the research team had no idea what was inside those containers. Employee Marie found the containers of pink slime and felt that they could pose a threat. It is assumed that she thoroughly concealed and kept them in (Redacted) status. If my assumption is correct, the melted object in those containers was probably the (Redacted) of (Redacted). I became sure of this when I read the passage that described its appearance as that of an adolescent human."<br>

	"I dunno if it was fortunate for us or not, but its memories, including those of the experiments, were completely gone; it could barely speak a word or two. It was also mentally unstable. It became extremely nervous whenever Marie was not present.<br>

	A brother. Marie had a brother whom she lost during her childhood. It all started when she felt an attachment to the childlike pink slime that followed her around. Marie showed an unprecedented level of decrease in her mental corruption. Indeed, it was extremely unusual. Of course, it was certain that the Abnormality somehow affected her in a positive way, but that was the end of the benefits.<br>
	
	Her colleagues started noticing her odd behaviors; they tried to ask her about them, it was the right thing to do. They were educated about the potential implications of a steep decrease in mental corruption levels, and understood that a person disappearing every single break time is a dangerous sign. However, Marie didn’t say a word to them and ended up detained in the counseling room until she opened up.<br>
	
	Meanwhile, this slimy creature that had forgotten everything instinctively remembered one thing: it had to get out of the facility no matter what. This Abnormality once again felt extremely nervous when Marie didn’t show up on time. It thought that she was in danger; it was then that it decided to escape WITH her. A rare bond had formed between the two. They cared about each other from the bottoms of their hearts."<br>

	"Confined within the counseling room, Marie eventually gave up her right to remain silent and began to reveal what she had done. How she kept the contents inside the container, and how she was able to form a bond with it. However, she couldn’t finish her words. This was because she melted in the blink of an eye, moments after signs of an anomaly showed up on her skin. Yes, she quite literally melted, melted in her entirety. And that wasn’t the end of it. The slime that once was Marie a few seconds ago began to move. It wasn’t a difficult task for a fluid creature to slide under the door of the counseling room.<br>

	Did it have a speck of human rationality? No. Just like a newborn duckling blindly follows its mother, it simply moved towards the Abnormality. And it wasn’t just Marie that turned to slime. Every single employee who had made contact with her in some way began to melt too. Those who were questioning her, who had shared a meal with her, who had worked together… Soon, this army of slime began to attack other employees. All for the mother slime, the Abnormality they loved. Yes, out of love and love alone, they killed."<br>

	"...and my dear employees, I do hope you all didn’t forget to put on the gas masks we distributed to you before we entered, did you? I do hope that no one took it off out of boredom or stuffiness. I must inform you all that some of you are already infected by the slime I told you about. We did not give gas masks to some of you, and we did say that it was because we were out of stock. Though, to be truthful, it was just so we could distinguish between those who are infected and those who are not. You may feel fine now, but before an hour passes, your flesh and bones will start to melt, and your mind will disintegrate into pitch-black nothingness. Then you will begin trying to wreak havoc on the facility. You’ll probably, as your first action in your new form, jump at the employees sitting right next to you. All for the mess of slime you so adore.<br>

	Yes, I know. It’s unbelievable. You feel so alive and clear now, just how on Earth could you melt down into slime? And yet you will. It’s not your fault of course. Someone among you made contact with the slime Abnormality, and you were just the unlucky sap who happened to be around that person. It’s meaningless now to determine patient zero. I doubt they had any idea how catastrophic the results of their actions would be. They did it out of pure affection, after all.<br>
	
	Finally, those uninfected who are wearing masks, please ensure you pay extra attention to your hygiene and immediately report when you see an employee acting out of the ordinary. You’ll simply be infected as well if you attempt to help them. Now, in your desks, there will be 9mm pistols, all perfectly locked and loaded. What you must do now should be clear. We will not open the doors until the situation is… taken care of. If you think this too cruel, allow me to remind you that this is your job. I hope to see you again once everything has been handled."}

	(CENSORED): I have no regrets. I’d say I’m pretty lucky compared to the others; at the very least I get to leave my last voice record. Well, I say “last” only as a precaution but…<br>

	Randy: All right, your record will be eternally archived and all our fellow employees will remember you. 3... 2... 1... End audio receiving.<br>

	(CENSORED): Randy... That looks, just like our (CENSORED) from long ago, doesn't it? ...Oh, I forgot for a moment that only I can see this. Employee (CENSORED) who was with me became (CENSORED)... It... looks like it can even breed... Employee (CENSORED) who was with me became (CENSORED)... This is just like the process of (CENSORED)... I feel a little sick, but I’m good...<br>
	A small (CENSORED) came out of employee (CENSORED)'s (CENSORED)... I can't believe this... Now it's starting to (CENSORED) employee (CENSORED)... Employee (CENSORED) is screaming like (CENSORED)... The cries... Can you hear them? It reminds me of (CENSORED)...<br>
	Sound: (CENSORED)——————————————————<br>
	Now I see... This is our (CENSORED)... This is the reason (CENSORED) exists... This is the worst thing I’ve seen in my life. I can’t even move. Looks like (CENSORED) has made me its next target. Soon... I will (CENSORED) too... It’s getting closer. I’ll put the recorder in my (CENSORED)...<br>
	I hope this record will help everyone...<br>

	"Even after we adopted the cognition filter, many of our managers have lost their minds. Half of them gone because of (CENSORED). Even if we raise the cognition filter to its maximum setting at the risk of having our employees and other Abnormalities being perceived as extremely simple objects, the managers will still be driven insane as soon as this Abnormality comes into sight.<br>
	We can’t make our manager blind just because of one Abnormality. We’re stuck in a dilemma. The only solution we could come up with was at the suggestion of one of our employees. It was to cover the Abnormality with a giant set of censors and blurring. If a flaw in the system disables the censors covering the Abnormality, we will once again have to sincerely consider how to dispose of the manager."}

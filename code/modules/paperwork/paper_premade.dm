	info = "Silkweaving is currently accessible to City Fixer Workshops or the Carnival in City of Light. Those who know the ways of the silk, are good people to ask if you are seeking out quality armor.\
			Using the bodies of fallen monsters, (and fellow humans?) You are able to weave them into silk, a valuable resource, which can be used to create new armor or upgrade already existing gear.<br>\
			<br>\
			<br>\
			<center><b> Part 1: Gathering Silk </b></center><br>\
			<br>\
			So, You are new to the trade and are oh so existed to be weaving new armor. But wait, you first need to gather your own silk! One path you can take is to do your own dirty work and head out into the backstreets and start hunting them by yourself!<br>\
			<br>\
			* If you are a Workshop Fixer in CF (City Fixer), you can find the necessary gear for silk gathering in the room above your workshop.<br>\
			<br>\
			* If you are the Carnival in CoL (City of Light), you can find the necessary gear for silk gathering in your hideout, which is on the far left side of the map.<br>\
			<br>\
			The next section will explain how each tool is used.<br>\
			<br>\
			<br>\
			<center><b> Part 2: Silkweaving Gear </b></center><br>\
			<br>\
			Now, You are able to find your silkweaving gear but you don’t have any idea on what they do? Well, Time to learn their basics!<br>\
			<br>\
			* <b>Silkweaver:</b> Your main silk gathering tool, When you attack a dead body you will butcher it and create a unique type of silk depending on the creature you butchered. Stronger creatures will give out more, and higher rarity silk. If a creature you butcher doesn’t have silk associated with them, they will drop a random simple silk. (Green, Indigo, Steel or Amber) Lastly, You are able to butcher humans with the silk knife. The stronger the human is, the more silk they will drop. However, if that human still has a soul, you will be unable to butcher them.<br>\
			<br>\
			* <b>Carnival Spear:</b> Your weapon of choice! (Workshop Fixers get a off-brand/weaker version of this weapon.) This is a normal spear which deals 30 BLACK damage on hit (The off-brand version deals 22 BLACK damage), However the main highlight of the carnival spear is that it deals double damage to most backstreets mobs!<br>\
			<br>\
			* <b>Silk Bag:</b> A Small bag which can hold a massive amount of silk! You can use it to store all of the silk you collect while hunting in the backstreets.<br>\
			<br>\
			* <b>Weaving Armor; Basic Edition:</b> A Book which holds all of the basic knowledge about silk weaving. This book allows you to create basic armor and weave meat into silk.<br>\
			<br>\
			* (Carnival Only) <b>Carnival Armor:</b> Armor designed by the carnival, perfect at resisting the most \
			common damage types in the backstreets!<br>\
			<br>\
			Now you know the gear you start out with, time to learn about your product... Silk!<br>\
			<br>\
			<br>\
			<center><b> Part 3: Silk Guide </b></center><br>\
			<br>\
			<center> =Types/Rarities= </center><br>\
			Silks have 2 important variables, Type and Rarity.<br>\
			The type of the silk is determined by the source of its creation, For example weaving Sweepers will produce Indigo Silk, While weaving Bots will produce Green Silk!<br>\
			<br>\
			The rarity of the silk is determined by the strength of the source, For example a Sweeper Scout will only create simple silk, while a normal Sweeper will create advanced silk and simple silk!<br>\
			There are 4 total rarities; Simple, Advanced, Elegant and Masterpiece.<br>\
			<br>\
			<center> =Silk Conversions/Transfers= </center><br>\
			For the Common Silks, You can relatively easily find monsters in the backstreets which you can butcher to gather their silk type. <br>\
			<br>\
			However, What if you need a masterpiece rarity silk but you can’t find a monster who can drop such silk? Or you are looking to get Crimson Silk which no monster drops?<br>\
			<br>\
			Well then, You arrive at Silk Conversions/Transfers! They are ways you are able to use your silk to change them into higher rarities or different types!<br>\
			<i>In order to unlock Silk Conversions/Transfers for Common Silks you will need to buy the “Weaving Armor: Common Conversions/Transfers Edition” Book.\
			While for Rare Silks you will need to buy the “Weaving Armor: Rare Conversions/Transfers Edition” Book</i><br>\
			<br>\
			Silk Conversions:<br>\
			Essentially, You are able to use 4 silks of the same type/rarity to combine them into one silk of the same type and higher rarity! For Example, Converting 4 Simple Green Silks will create 1 Advanced Green Silk.<br>\
			<br>\
			Silk Transfers:<br>\
			Certain silks are able to be transferred into other silks!<br>\
			Here is a small table to show what silks can be transferred into.<br>\
			<br>\
			Common Transfers:<br>\
			2 Simple Green -> 1 Simple Steel<br>\
			2 Simple Indigo -> 1 Simple Amber<br>\
			<br>\
			Rare Transfers:<br>\
			2 Simple Steel -> 1 Simple Crimson<br>\
			2 Simple Amber -> 1 Simple Violet<br>\
			1 Advanced Violet + 1 Advanced Crimson -> 1 Simple Azure<br>\
			1 Simple Steel + 1 Simple Amber -> 1 Simple Shrimple<br>\
			<br>\
			Human Supplements <i>(You can only get this Transfer from the book, Weaving Armor: Human Supplements Edition) </i>:<br>\
			2 Simple Shrimple -> 1 Simple Human<br>\
			<br>\
			<br>\
			<center>=Silk Uses=<br></center>\
			As you may have read in the above sections, Silk can be used for 2 things. <br>\
			One, You are able to attach your silk to armor in order to upgrade it!<br>\
			The type of the silk will determine how to change your armor, while rarity will determine the size of the change.<br>\
			For example, a Simple Indigo Silk will give you +5% BLACK and -5% RED. An Advanced Indigo Silk will multiply both of those values by 2, Giving you +10 BLACK and -10% RED. Elegant Silk multiplies the simple value by 3, while Masterpiece Silk multiples it by 4.<br>\
			<br>\
			However, Any time silk increases your resistance to something, It also decreases your resistance to something else. So upgrade with caution! <br>\
			<i>(At maximum, you can increase your resistance to a damage type to 40%. However you can go infinitely negative.)</i><br>\
			<br>\
			And Two, You can use them as resources to tailor new armor! In order to weave armor from silk, you will need to buy some weaving books from your tailoring vending machine! It should be in the same place where you found your silkweaving gear.<br>\
			<br>\
			<center>=Available Silks=</center><br>\
			Here is the current list of all silks you can get in the game.<br>\
			<br>\
			<b>Available Common Silks</b><br>\
			|  Silk Type |         Armor Effect      |     Common Sources    |<br>\
			| ---------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |<br>\
			| Indigo Silk|     BLACK +5%, RED -5%    |        Sweepers       |<br>\
			| Green Silk |      RED +5%, BLACK -5%   |          Bots         |<br>\
			| Amber Silk |    BLACK +5%, WHITE -5%   |          Worms        |<br>\
			| Steel Silk |     RED +5%, WHITE -5%    |    G-Corp Remnants    |<br>\
			| Human Silk | PALE +5%, RED/WHITE -2.5% | Flesh Monsters/Humans |<br>\
			<br>\

			|  Azure Silk   |  RED/BLACK +2.5%, RED -5%  | Resurgence Clan Machines|<br>\
			| Shrimple Silk | WHITE +5%, RED/BLACK -2.5% |      Silk Transfers     |<br>\
			<br>\
			<br>\
			<center><b> Part 4: Armor Tailoring </b></center><br>\
			<br>\
			Oh boy that was a lot of silk info, but now we are getting to the part you might have been looking forward to, TAILORING ARMOR! Yes, As long as you have enough silk you will be able to tailor nearly any armor in the game... As long as you have the right book. You are able to get weaving armor books from your weaving vending machine which you should be able to find in your base.<br>\
			<br>\
			I can tell you right now that they aren't cheap, Costing 1000 ahn per book.<br>\
			* (If you are a workshop fixer in CF, Books will only cost 200 ahn. So... lucky you.)<br>\
			<br>\
			However, The cost is quite worth it as once you get your hands on one book you can reuse it as much as you want and even give it out to your fellow Tailors! Once you do read the book, you will be able to learn how to craft all of the armor from the faction the book is about!<br>\
			<br>\
			<br>\
			<center><b> Part 5: The End </b></center><br>\
			<br>\
			Well, You were able to learn a lot about silk today... Now, It is up to you to sell your products!<br>\
			<br>\
			<i>Good Luck...</i> <br>"

	Grade 9 Fixers will be able to learn level 1 Skills, Which are your main abilities for surviving in the backstreets ranging from healing and movement. You are also able to learn 5 of them at this level.<br>\
	<br>\
	Grade 8 Fixers are also able to learn level 1 Skills, but they are only able to learn 3 level 1 Skills. However, if they already knew 5 level 1 skills they will keep those skills.<br>\
	<br>\
	Grade 7 and 6 Fixers will be able to learn level 2 Skills, Which are your main utility, making gathering and looting easier. At this point and all higher grades, you will also be unable to learn skills of a lower level. So be cautious of over leveling.<br>\
	<br>\
	Grade 5 Fixers will be able to learn level 3 Skill, Which are your passives, you are able too toggle them on and off to gain benefits and downsides while they are active. You are only able to learn one of this skill.<br>\
	<br>\
	Finaly, Grade 4 Fixers will be able to learn level 4 Skills, Which are your 'Ultimate' abilities. They hold powerful effects, but come at the cost off having very long cooldowns. You are only able to learn one of this skill.<br>\

	<br>
	Recently, it has been discovered that trace elements generated by abnormalities in the work process, normally prone to disappearing after work, can be refined into a stable form- from here on, known as Enkephalin-Derived Substances, or EDS.<br>
	<br>
	As of now, this only has distinct properties from ZAYIN-class abnormalities. However, all other abnormalities have shown the ability to produce the same generic set, apparently at random.<br>
	<br>
	To retrieve a sample of an EDS, the abnormality must first be 100% understood. Then, you may fit the containment cell with a Chemical Extraction Cell Upgrade.<br>
	<br>
	Once both these conditions are met, work must recommence on the abnormality; the Chemical Extraction Cell Upgrade will then keep the abnormality primed to produce an EDS.<br>
	<br>
	Finally, approach the abnormality in its cell while holding an appropriate receptacle. Some will offer it willingly, some will need to be more directly interacted with. This does not constitute work in itself.<br>
	<br>
	For each one completed work, you may perform one harvest. The quality of the work does not matter for the purposes of EDS extraction.<br>
	<br>
	The Enkephalin-Derived Substance Analyzer is an experimental tool that will inform you of the basic properties held by any EDS in the vessel you scan with it. Simply hold it in hand and use it on a vessel containing at least one EDS.<br>
	<br>
	In order to understand and record the full breadth of an EDS's effect, it is recommended that a subject imbibe a small portion of it under safe conditions.<br>

	info = "<B>Roles:</B><BR>\nThe Detective is basically the investigator and prosecutor.<BR>\nThe Staff Assistant can perform these functions with written authority from the Detective.<BR>\nThe Captain/HoP/Warden is ct as the judicial authority.<BR>\nThe Security Officers are responsible for executing warrants, security during trial, and prisoner transport.<BR>\n<BR>\n<B>Investigative Phase:</B><BR>\nAfter the crime has been committed the Detective's job is to gather evidence and try to ascertain not only who did it but what happened. He must take special care to catalogue everything and don't leave anything out. Write out all the evidence on paper. Make sure you take an appropriate number of fingerprints. IF he must ask someone questions he has permission to confront them. If the person refuses he can ask a judicial authority to write a subpoena for questioning. If again he fails to respond then that person is to be jailed as insubordinate and obstructing justice. Said person will be released after he cooperates.<BR>\n<BR>\nONCE the FT has a clear idea as to who the criminal is he is to write an arrest warrant on the piece of paper. IT MUST LIST THE CHARGES. The FT is to then go to the judicial authority and explain a small version of his case. If the case is moderately acceptable the authority should sign it. Security must then execute said warrant.<BR>\n<BR>\n<B>Pre-Pre-Trial Phase:</B><BR>\nNow a legal representative must be presented to the defendant if said defendant requests one. That person and the defendant are then to be given time to meet (in the jail IS ACCEPTABLE). The defendant and his lawyer are then to be given a copy of all the evidence that will be presented at trial (rewriting it all on paper is fine). THIS IS CALLED THE DISCOVERY PACK. With a few exceptions, THIS IS THE ONLY EVIDENCE BOTH SIDES MAY USE AT TRIAL. IF the prosecution will be seeking the death penalty it MUST be stated at this time. ALSO if the defense will be seeking not guilty by mental defect it must state this at this time to allow ample time for examination.<BR>\nNow at this time each side is to compile a list of witnesses. By default, the defendant is on both lists regardless of anything else. Also the defense and prosecution can compile more evidence beforehand BUT in order for it to be used the evidence MUST also be given to the other side.\nThe defense has time to compile motions against some evidence here.<BR>\n<B>Possible Motions:</B><BR>\n1. <U>Invalidate Evidence-</U> Something with the evidence is wrong and the evidence is to be thrown out. This includes irrelevance or corrupt security.<BR>\n2. <U>Free Movement-</U> Basically the defendant is to be kept uncuffed before and during the trial.<BR>\n3. <U>Subpoena Witness-</U> If the defense presents god reasons for needing a witness but said person fails to cooperate then a subpoena is issued.<BR>\n4. <U>Drop the Charges-</U> Not enough evidence is there for a trial so the charges are to be dropped. The FT CAN RETRY but the judicial authority must carefully reexamine the new evidence.<BR>\n5. <U>Declare Incompetent-</U> Basically the defendant is insane. Once this is granted a medical official is to examine the patient. If he is indeed insane he is to be placed under care of the medical staff until he is deemed competent to stand trial.<BR>\n<BR>\nALL SIDES MOVE TO A COURTROOM<BR>\n<B>Pre-Trial Hearings:</B><BR>\nA judicial authority and the 2 sides are to meet in the trial room. NO ONE ELSE BESIDES A SECURITY DETAIL IS TO BE PRESENT. The defense submits a plea. If the plea is guilty then proceed directly to sentencing phase. Now the sides each present their motions to the judicial authority. He rules on them. Each side can debate each motion. Then the judicial authority gets a list of crew members. He first gets a chance to look at them all and pick out acceptable and available jurors. Those jurors are then called over. Each side can ask a few questions and dismiss jurors they find too biased. HOWEVER before dismissal the judicial authority MUST agree to the reasoning.<BR>\n<BR>\n<B>The Trial:</B><BR>\nThe trial has three phases.<BR>\n1. <B>Opening Arguments</B>- Each side can give a short speech. They may not present ANY evidence.<BR>\n2. <B>Witness Calling/Evidence Presentation</B>- The prosecution goes first and is able to call the witnesses on his approved list in any order. He can recall them if necessary. During the questioning the lawyer may use the evidence in the questions to help prove a point. After every witness the other side has a chance to cross-examine. After both sides are done questioning a witness the prosecution can present another or recall one (even the EXACT same one again!). After prosecution is done the defense can call witnesses. After the initial cases are presented both sides are free to call witnesses on either list.<BR>\nFINALLY once both sides are done calling witnesses we move onto the next phase.<BR>\n3. <B>Closing Arguments</B>- Same as opening.<BR>\nThe jury then deliberates IN PRIVATE. THEY MUST ALL AGREE on a verdict. REMEMBER: They mix between some charges being guilty and others not guilty (IE if you supposedly killed someone with a gun and you unfortunately picked up a gun without authorization then you CAN be found not guilty of murder BUT guilty of possession of illegal weaponry.). Once they have agreed they present their verdict. If unable to reach a verdict and feel they will never they call a deadlocked jury and we restart at Pre-Trial phase with an entirely new set of jurors.<BR>\n<BR>\n<B>Sentencing Phase:</B><BR>\nIf the death penalty was sought (you MUST have gone through a trial for death penalty) then skip to the second part. <BR>\nI. Each side can present more evidence/witnesses in any order. There is NO ban on emotional aspects or anything. The prosecution is to submit a suggested penalty. After all the sides are done then the judicial authority is to give a sentence.<BR>\nII. The jury stays and does the same thing as I. Their sole job is to determine if the death penalty is applicable. If NOT then the judge selects a sentence.<BR>\n<BR>\nTADA you're done. Security then executes the sentence and adds the applicable convictions to the person's record.<BR>\n"

A solution to rising crime rates and falling productivity, these facilities are specifically designed for the safe, productive imprisonment of your most dangerous criminals.  <br><br>To press a long-term prisoner into the service of the station, replace his equipment with prisoners' garb at one of the prison lockers, as per normal operating procedure.  Before assigning a prisoner his ID, insert the ID into a prisoner management console and assign the prisoner a quota, based on the severity of his crime.  <br>A single sheet of most materials produces five points for the prisoner, and points can be expected to be produced at a rate of about 100 per minute, though punishments as severe as forced labor should be reserved for serious crimes of sentences not less than five minutes long.<br>Once you have prepared the prisoner, place him in the secure northern half of the labor shuttle, and send him to the station.  Once he meets his quota by feeding sheets to the stacker, he will be allowed to return to the station, and will be able to open the secure door to the prisoner release area.<br><br>In the case of dangerous prisoners, surveillance may be needed. To that end, there is a prisoner monitoring room on the mining station, equipped with a remote flasher and a lockdown button.  The mine itself is patrolled by a securibot, so the nearby security records console can also be used to secure hostile prisoners on the mine."

	<br>
	I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures that are required,
	avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.

	I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science,
	and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug.

	I will not be ashamed to say "I know not,"
	nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient's recovery.
	<br>
	I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death.
	If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life;
	this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God.

	I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability.

			Seek honor, seek to kill the strong, and take money for your slaughter if the opportunity arrives. \
			Using a disguise is dishonorable, as is using ranged weapons and stun weapons, and attacking someone that is not significantly stronger than you while not in an agreed duel. \
			If anyone uses cheese tactics against you, or attacks you for no reason while not in a duel, they are dishonorable. \

Its head doesn’t have anything that could be described as “Eyes,” insead it has a single horizontal red line though the middle of its head.</p> <p>|Excerpt from Counseling Records|</p> <p>It was a quiet break, |Redacted| was just resting along the bench, Both a bit tired from having to take care of T-02-14-T. We were chatting about what we were planning to do after we finished our work today. He said something about going to a new restaurant that was in town, A poor dream that he would never be able to reach.</p> <p>Then we both heard a slight scratching of metal around us. Slowly growing louder and louder. We both stepped away from each other, Not knowing where to go.</p> <p>I searched for some clues to what was causing such a sound. During my last 2 weeks here I could not remember what could have caused this. Then it happened, The quick slice blazed through the air. |Redacted| didn’t even have a chance to look at it as it ripped open his chest from behind him.</p> <p>And the thing is, He didn’t die right away… That beast, It lifted him and brought him to its face. |Redacted| tried his best to move out of its grip, But had no more strength left after losing his lower half. All I could do is run for my life, Not looking back while hearing |Redacted| calling my name before one more crunch coming from his head. Bits of |Redacted|’s bones and blood sprayed in front of me as I shouted for help…</p> <p>There was nothing that I could do, Poor |Redacted|… I just left him behind while he got butchered… To think I should call myself the “Hero” for being able to shut down the info department, is pure disgusting…</p> <p>Once them Rabbits took that thing out… I walked across the bloody hallways, To think that I forced all of those clerks and agents to fight- No, To be hunted by that beast turns me off. Was there anything that I could do? No, But at the very least… I live to be eliminated another day…</p> <p>|Counseling Record Excerpt End|</p> <p>|Apex Work Log|</p> <p>Systems Rebooting… Reactivating Base Protocols in 3… 2… 1…</p> <p>Joey: Eek!

Unlike most abnos around here, He is one of the few ones who does deserve some respect around here. But yes, I did want to report something about Timmy.</p> <p>Dr. Eberwin: As you say so, Timmy was his preferred name right? What caused you to wish to speak up about him? After all, He has not been reported to really be doing anything.</p> <p>Roy: Yep, It was during that last incident I had to handle. When that, Um… Miner pal broke out? Yep, him. When I came down to suppress him I noticed how Timmy was also in the same room where the Miner was wreaking havoc. This eventually led to the Miner losing all focus on the humans to just attack Timmy.</p> <p>Dr. Eberwin: Indeed that was a useful moment when we got to use Timmy’s abilities. But what caught your eye during this moment?</p> <p>Roy: The thing that I was leading too, While he was being attacked by the Miner he still kept up the innocent simple as usual. However, Near the end of the suppression, I swear to the wings but I could see a tear come down from his eye.</p> <p>Dr. Eberwin: Really now, Are you suggesting that he felt but about being beaten up. Like that would be a surprise.</p> <p>Roy: No, It was not that. It was almost like, He felt sorry. Sorry for something that I don’t understand. Do you think you can take a closer inspection on him in the upcoming days? Feel like we would need to just make sure everything around him is safe…</p> <p>Dr. Eberwin: Really, that is all you have to say?</p> <p>Roy: Yep, That is all.</p> <p>Dr. Eberwin: Okay, This request might be looked into further.</p> <p>Roy: Good to hear that we might know a bit more about this little Timmy…</p> <p>|End of Excerpt|</p> <p>|Old Note|</p> <p><em>I’ve always dreamed of being like those heroes told in legends and comics. Being able to protect the people they care about and save the day.</em></p> <p><em>It seemed to be an aspiration out of my reach. A distant dream whilst I lie here on my earthen bed.</em></p> <p><em>I’m just a rock after all</em></p> <p><em>I’ve seen slaughters in front of me. Yet I can’t save any of them.

Its head doesn’t have anything that could be described as “Eyes,” insead it has a single horizontal red line though the middle of its head.</p> <p>|Excerpt from Counseling Records|</p> <p>It was a quiet break, |Redacted| was just resting along the bench, Both a bit tired from having to take care of T-02-14-T. We were chatting about what we were planning to do after we finished our work today. He said something about going to a new restaurant that was in town, A poor dream that he would never be able to reach.</p> <p>Then we both heard a slight scratching of metal around us. Slowly growing louder and louder. We both stepped away from each other, Not knowing where to go.</p> <p>I searched for some clues to what was causing such a sound. During my last 2 weeks here I could not remember what could have caused this. Then it happened, The quick slice blazed through the air. |Redacted| didn’t even have a chance to look at it as it ripped open his chest from behind him.</p> <p>And the thing is, He didn’t die right away… That beast, It lifted him and brought him to its face. |Redacted| tried his best to move out of its grip, But had no more strength left after losing his lower half. All I could do is run for my life, Not looking back while hearing |Redacted| calling my name before one more crunch coming from his head. Bits of |Redacted|’s bones and blood sprayed in front of me as I shouted for help…</p> <p>There was nothing that I could do, Poor |Redacted|… I just left him behind while he got butchered… To think I should call myself the “Hero” for being able to shut down the info department, is pure disgusting…</p> <p>Once them Rabbits took that thing out… I walked across the bloody hallways, To think that I forced all of those clerks and agents to fight- No, To be hunted by that beast turns me off. Was there anything that I could do? No, But at the very least… I live to be eliminated another day…</p> <p>|Counseling Record Excerpt End|</p> <p>|Apex Work Log|</p> <p>Systems Rebooting… Reactivating Base Protocols in 3… 2… 1…</p> <p>Joey: Eek!

What should I do now?</p> <p>Recording Voice of H-152… Recording Complete. Analyzing Weaknesses…</p> <p>Joey: So… Manager told me that I need to w-work with you… Oh, I need to say the thing, Um… Commencing Insight work.</p> <p>Weaknesses Analyzed, Wearing E.G.O of Subject T-01-118-W, Weak to Pale Damage. Weapon deals Red Damage, Starting Adapting Armor Protocol … Reactivating Analysis Protocol…</p> <p>Joey: So… I see how you were built to, As you c-call it “Eliminating” us… Can you, S-Speak about it?</p> <p>Mental Fortitude of H-152 classified as “Fragile.” Fear Tactics reasonable to proceed with…</p> <p>D-05-146-W: Sanity of H-152 below 50%.

This will cause a small set of pods to drop off around the facility containing 10 ft tall bees wearing simple armor.</p> <p>For that reason, It is recommended for all agents who work with T-01-118-W to never show any signs of weakness or give them any hope of being able to get out of here.</p> <hr> <p><em>Yet another day I am trapped on enemy territory… However, It does seem like they are losing members!

Whenever the Pale Horse appears in a room, A veil of smoke appears around it.</p> <p>|Excerpt from the “Denial of Joy” Storybook|</p> <p>Once upon a time, There was a simple Farmer who lived outside the nearby town. He was known for being the one who kept this town a float, bringing a plentiful harvest every year. </p> <p>However, He was never alone in his efforts as he lived with 4 beautiful horses. One was known for their speed, With their crimson red mane brushing though the wind as they ran through the fields helping the farmer collect his crops. Another one was the most elegant of the 4, Having a brilliant viridescent mane, It brought life into crops that were falling. The 3rd one had a keen eye for unwanted crops, Their silver mane was short and clear as they were the ones in charge of keeping all of the weeds away. </p> <p>Together, All of them kept the crops of the farmer all well and-. Oh, Did I forget one? Oh yes, Last one of the 4 horses… They were the smallest of the 4, Yet they also cursed in having nothing to help the dear Farmer. They could not speed though the fields, collecting the crops. They could not inspire all of the crops to grow nor could he spot crooked weeds… All that he could do was stay in his stables and let the passing villagers watch him rest all day.<br>The small little horse could not accept his terrible curse and said to himself “All of my Dearest Siblings are working hard and bringing joy to everyone, While I just sit here and rest knowing this safety was not earned by me. I do not deserve to receive their gifts, Until the day I can prove myself…” And from that day onwards, the little Horse covered its eyes with its light and fragile pale mane…</p> <p>Eventaly, While all of the Pale Horse siblings were out working, The little horse tried to make a wish. “I rest in these stables everyday while my siblings work tirelessly using their wonderful gifts. I wish to know why I wasn’t able to receive a gift like them, To know why I was cursed to be like this…” The Little Horse made this wish many times without an answer. However, Today was different as the little horse heard a voice in its head. “Dear Little pale one, You remark on your gift like it was a curse. What causes you to believe you need a different one?”</p> <p>The Horse remarks “They work everyday bringing joy to all and yet, I do nothing. I bring nothing as I bring no joy…” The Voice answers, “Poor Little one, You believe you have seen all that comes with the gifts of your siblings while you haven’t seen your own home in many years?”<br>The Little Horse exclaims, “I hear the words of the villagers! Everyday they bring news of the wonderful acts they have done!” The Voice replies “Little Horse, I can bring you the gift you wish to have. But you need to be willing to understand that there is no true gift unlike yours…” The Little Horse nods eagerly. “Very well” The Voice remarks in a defeated tone, “Open your eyes. See what you could gain…”</p> <p>Once the little horse opened its eyes, The revelation came to it. It could see the Farm and the Town at first, Seeing the joyful villagers feast on the gloryful harvest. But for once, It could see past the town. Another village, But this one was much older. In that village, There was no joy to be found. Only burning buildings caused by War. The rotting food caused by the pestilence and the grieving townspeople caused by Conquest. The Little horse finally realized the true nature of his siblings’ gifts, no matter how much is given. The same needs to be taken away…</p> <p>From that onwards, The Little Horse left its home to find more of the village like the old one. Whenever it comes across someone who is impacted by the gifts of its siblings, All it could do is mourn for those who gave away their joy for them…</p> <p>|Excerpt End|</p>";

The stone appears to be made of granite, it weighs approximately 20 pounds.</p> <p>|Excerpt from Counseling Log #4-59|</p> <p>Note: This document is set to deletion within the next few days due to violating our policies around abnormalities.</p> <p>Dr. Eberwin: Pleasure to meet you Agent Roy, I heard that you wished to speak with a counselor regarding O-04-120-T?</p> <p>Roy: Now come on now Doc, Don’t you think it is a bit more appropriate to call him by the name that he wishes to be called. Unlike most abnos around here, He is one of the few ones who does deserve some respect around here. But yes, I did want to report something about Timmy.</p> <p>Dr. Eberwin: As you say so, Timmy was his preferred name right? What caused you to wish to speak up about him? After all, He has not been reported to really be doing anything.</p> <p>Roy: Yep, It was during that last incident I had to handle. When that, Um… Miner pal broke out? Yep, him. When I came down to suppress him I noticed how Timmy was also in the same room where the Miner was wreaking havoc. This eventually led to the Miner losing all focus on the humans to just attack Timmy.</p> <p>Dr. Eberwin: Indeed that was a useful moment when we got to use Timmy’s abilities. But what caught your eye during this moment?</p> <p>Roy: The thing that I was leading too, While he was being attacked by the Miner he still kept up the innocent simple as usual. However, Near the end of the suppression, I swear to the wings but I could see a tear come down from his eye.</p> <p>Dr. Eberwin: Really now, Are you suggesting that he felt but about being beaten up. Like that would be a surprise.</p> <p>Roy: No, It was not that. It was almost like, He felt sorry. Sorry for something that I don’t understand. Do you think you can take a closer inspection on him in the upcoming days? Feel like we would need to just make sure everything around him is safe…</p> <p>Dr. Eberwin: Really, that is all you have to say?</p> <p>Roy: Yep, That is all.</p> <p>Dr. Eberwin: Okay, This request might be looked into further.</p> <p>Roy: Good to hear that we might know a bit more about this little Timmy…</p> <p>|End of Excerpt|</p> <p>|Old Note|</p> <p><em>I’ve always dreamed of being like those heroes told in legends and comics. Being able to protect the people they care about and save the day.</em></p> <p><em>It seemed to be an aspiration out of my reach. A distant dream whilst I lie here on my earthen bed.</em></p> <p><em>I’m just a rock after all</em></p> <p><em>I’ve seen slaughters in front of me. Yet I can’t save any of them. I can’t stop such an occurrence.</em></p> <p><em>After all, I’m just a rock</em></p> <p><em>Centuries have passed, civilizations have fallen, Forests have blackened, and yet I remain here.

I must do something before I crumble to dust like everything else I’ve seen.</em></p> <p><em>If I can save one person from dying, I could go to rest easily.

Whenever the Pale Horse appears in a room, A veil of smoke appears around it.</p> <p>|Excerpt from the “Denial of Joy” Storybook|</p> <p>Once upon a time, There was a simple Farmer who lived outside the nearby town. He was known for being the one who kept this town a float, bringing a plentiful harvest every year. </p> <p>However, He was never alone in his efforts as he lived with 4 beautiful horses. One was known for their speed, With their crimson red mane brushing though the wind as they ran through the fields helping the farmer collect his crops. Another one was the most elegant of the 4, Having a brilliant viridescent mane, It brought life into crops that were falling. The 3rd one had a keen eye for unwanted crops, Their silver mane was short and clear as they were the ones in charge of keeping all of the weeds away. </p> <p>Together, All of them kept the crops of the farmer all well and-. Oh, Did I forget one? Oh yes, Last one of the 4 horses… They were the smallest of the 4, Yet they also cursed in having nothing to help the dear Farmer. They could not speed though the fields, collecting the crops. They could not inspire all of the crops to grow nor could he spot crooked weeds… All that he could do was stay in his stables and let the passing villagers watch him rest all day.<br>The small little horse could not accept his terrible curse and said to himself “All of my Dearest Siblings are working hard and bringing joy to everyone, While I just sit here and rest knowing this safety was not earned by me. I do not deserve to receive their gifts, Until the day I can prove myself…” And from that day onwards, the little Horse covered its eyes with its light and fragile pale mane…</p> <p>Eventaly, While all of the Pale Horse siblings were out working, The little horse tried to make a wish. “I rest in these stables everyday while my siblings work tirelessly using their wonderful gifts. I wish to know why I wasn’t able to receive a gift like them, To know why I was cursed to be like this…” The Little Horse made this wish many times without an answer. However, Today was different as the little horse heard a voice in its head. “Dear Little pale one, You remark on your gift like it was a curse. What causes you to believe you need a different one?”</p> <p>The Horse remarks “They work everyday bringing joy to all and yet, I do nothing. I bring nothing as I bring no joy…” The Voice answers, “Poor Little one, You believe you have seen all that comes with the gifts of your siblings while you haven’t seen your own home in many years?”<br>The Little Horse exclaims, “I hear the words of the villagers! Everyday they bring news of the wonderful acts they have done!” The Voice replies “Little Horse, I can bring you the gift you wish to have. But you need to be willing to understand that there is no true gift unlike yours…” The Little Horse nods eagerly. “Very well” The Voice remarks in a defeated tone, “Open your eyes. See what you could gain…”</p> <p>Once the little horse opened its eyes, The revelation came to it. It could see the Farm and the Town at first, Seeing the joyful villagers feast on the gloryful harvest. But for once, It could see past the town. Another village, But this one was much older. In that village, There was no joy to be found. Only burning buildings caused by War. The rotting food caused by the pestilence and the grieving townspeople caused by Conquest. The Little horse finally realized the true nature of his siblings’ gifts, no matter how much is given. The same needs to be taken away…</p> <p>From that onwards, The Little Horse left its home to find more of the village like the old one. Whenever it comes across someone who is impacted by the gifts of its siblings, All it could do is mourn for those who gave away their joy for them…</p> <p>|Excerpt End|</p>";

On closer inspection it was found that there was a bleeding humanoid body hidden underneath the dirt.</p> <p>The continent unit that we are currently using to hold F-01-26-Z has been reported to slowly forming cracks as long as we have been holding F-01-26-Z. However, It does not seem like this is causing any negative effects to the facility as a whole. It is also noted that F-01-26-Z has been easier to work with then more time has passed which is another reason as it is not recommended to fix the walls in F-01-26-Z’s continent unit.</p> <p>It is seen how F-01-26-Z eventually starts moving to one of the cracks in the wall. Then they place one of their vines into the crack.</p> <p>F-01-26-Z: Where are you now, ? The pulses of your beating soul are dimmed… Did your form become skinned?</p> <p>4 minutes and 26 seconds pass before F-01-26-Z moves once more, This time it was appearing to be placing down more of its vines into the crack.</p> <p>F-01-26-Z: Another one has fallen once more… Another that shall not be cared for…</p> <p>After 2 minutes and 4 seconds, F-01-26-Z pulls out ‘s body out of the crack in the wall. It appears that was missing their head upon being pulled in.</p> <p>F-01-26-Z: Poor little light, Your soul was pure and white… Yet when you broke your heart, Your soul grew tart… You had the moment to atone, But you were thrown prone…</p> <p>Around this time, The Contentment unit was starting to gather more and more purple and yellow petals which were starting to fly out of the cracks in the walls. All of the petals seem to be hovering around F-01-26-Z and , Slowly covering them both.</p> <p>F-01-26-Z: Nonetheless, All deserve a chance to cleanse the rotting soul of one’s own form… Yet to grow from their ruined core, One will need to shelter from one’s storm… , May you rest for all…</p> <p>For a brief moment before both of them are fully covered, ’s body begins to sink into the ground. After this the Camera also becomes fully covered by the petals.</p> <p>After this event, A single new yellow flower appeared in one of the cracks in the walls. A dim yellow light emitted from it. The facility also could not find ’s body anywhere in the facility.</p>";

Unlike most abnos around here, He is one of the few ones who does deserve some respect around here. But yes, I did want to report something about Timmy.</p> <p>Dr. Eberwin: As you say so, Timmy was his preferred name right? What caused you to wish to speak up about him? After all, He has not been reported to really be doing anything.</p> <p>Roy: Yep, It was during that last incident I had to handle. When that, Um… Miner pal broke out? Yep, him. When I came down to suppress him I noticed how Timmy was also in the same room where the Miner was wreaking havoc. This eventually led to the Miner losing all focus on the humans to just attack Timmy.</p> <p>Dr. Eberwin: Indeed that was a useful moment when we got to use Timmy’s abilities. But what caught your eye during this moment?</p> <p>Roy: The thing that I was leading too, While he was being attacked by the Miner he still kept up the innocent simple as usual. However, Near the end of the suppression, I swear to the wings but I could see a tear come down from his eye.</p> <p>Dr. Eberwin: Really now, Are you suggesting that he felt but about being beaten up. Like that would be a surprise.</p> <p>Roy: No, It was not that. It was almost like, He felt sorry. Sorry for something that I don’t understand. Do you think you can take a closer inspection on him in the upcoming days? Feel like we would need to just make sure everything around him is safe…</p> <p>Dr. Eberwin: Really, that is all you have to say?</p> <p>Roy: Yep, That is all.</p> <p>Dr. Eberwin: Okay, This request might be looked into further.</p> <p>Roy: Good to hear that we might know a bit more about this little Timmy…</p> <p>|End of Excerpt|</p> <p>|Old Note|</p> <p><em>I’ve always dreamed of being like those heroes told in legends and comics.

What causes you to believe you need a different one?”</p> <p>The Horse remarks “They work everyday bringing joy to all and yet, I do nothing. I bring nothing as I bring no joy…” The Voice answers, “Poor Little one, You believe you have seen all that comes with the gifts of your siblings while you haven’t seen your own home in many years?”<br>The Little Horse exclaims, “I hear the words of the villagers! Everyday they bring news of the wonderful acts they have done!” The Voice replies “Little Horse, I can bring you the gift you wish to have. But you need to be willing to understand that there is no true gift unlike yours…” The Little Horse nods eagerly. “Very well” The Voice remarks in a defeated tone, “Open your eyes. See what you could gain…”</p> <p>Once the little horse opened its eyes, The revelation came to it. It could see the Farm and the Town at first, Seeing the joyful villagers feast on the gloryful harvest. But for once, It could see past the town. Another village, But this one was much older. In that village, There was no joy to be found. Only burning buildings caused by War. The rotting food caused by the pestilence and the grieving townspeople caused by Conquest.

Their words seem to strengthen F-02-24-H’s ability in combat which often leads to making the suppression of F-02-24-H become much more difficult. However, Killing a critter leads to dangerous consequences as F-02-24-H becomes enraged after their death. That’s why it is recommended to keep them immobilized rather than killing them.</p>";
